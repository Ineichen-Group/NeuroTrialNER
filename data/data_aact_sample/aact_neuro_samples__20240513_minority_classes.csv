NCT00817128,Procedure,Pain Exposure Physical Therapy Or Conservative Therapy for Patients With Complex Regional Pain Syndrome Type I,"The current Dutch CBO guideline treatment of Complex Regional Pain Syndrome Type I (CRPS-1) is very disappointing with chronification, disability and subsequent high medical costs and personal suffering. A possible better treatment is intensive function-oriented physical therapy or Pain Exposure in Physical Therapy (PEPT). However, there are no adequate studies performed that demonstrate the efficacy of PEPT and therefore PEPT is lacking in the Dutch CBO CRPS-1 guidelines. Despite a lacking scientific argumentation, the PEPT approach or Macedonian therapy, is now being adopted on a large scale among physical therapists in The Netherlands. There are two level C retrospective cohort studies demonstrating a promising and clinical relevant beneficial effect on pain and function after PEPT. In response to the growing demand for scientific argumentation among doctors and physical therapists with respect to the efficacy of PEPT, we conducted a pilot study at the UMC St Radboud Nijmegen. The results of this pilot study were very promising and therefore, we decided to design a large RCT to investigate the treatment effects and costs in CRPS patients treated with PEPT compared to CRPS patients treated with usual therapy according to the Dutch CBO guidelines."

NCT01826058,Radiation,Spine Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Metastatic Epidural Spinal Cord: Prospective Phase II Study,"Metastatic epidural spinal cord compression (MESCC) is a frequent oncologic emergency that requires to be treated promptly. Although direct decompressive surgery is the most effective treatment, surgery is only used in selected patients because most patients have a poor overall condition and short life expectancy. Radiation therapy (RT), therefore, is the most commonly used for patients with MESCC, but conventional RT alone can achieve modest neurologic outcomes.

The hypothesis to use stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for MESCC is that the rapid decompression of epidural mass, durable local control and subsequently improved neurologic outcomes compared to conventional RT are expected when MESCC is treated with SBRT."

NCT02180867,Radiation,Pazopanib Neoadjuvant Trial in Non-Rhabdomyosarcoma Soft Tissue Sarcomas (PAZNTIS): A Phase II/III Randomized Trial of Preoperative Chemoradiation or Preoperative Radiation Plus or Minus Pazopanib (NSC# 737754),"This randomized phase II/III trial studies how well pazopanib, when combined with chemotherapy and radiation therapy or radiation therapy alone, work in the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas that can eventually be removed by surgery. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as ifosfamide and doxorubicin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Pazopanib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether these therapies can be safely combined and if they work better when given together in treating patients with non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas."
NCT02249572,Radiation,Vestibular Schwannoma - Radiosurgery or Expectation,"The purpose of this study is to compare the outcome of patients with vestibular schwannomas in two groups of randomised to either radiosurgery or expectation.

The optimal treatment for a small vestibular schwannoma is a matter of controversy and there are no class 1 studies investigating this. Even the natural tumor growth rate remains controversial and is reported to be from near 100% of cases showing growth to 40-60% in various reports. The clinical results of various treatment strategies are documented, but comparative studies are very few. Immediate radiosurgery or wait-and scan with subsequent treatment upon growth are two strategies that have both been used in many different centers. There are only two studies comparing these treatment modalities .These studies indicate significant effect of GKRS in reducing tumor growth, with less differences in hearing and complaint outcomes. None of the studies are blinded or randomised, allowing for bias.

The present study aims at comparing the two modalities above. To achieve this, we intend to randomise patients with newly diagnosed VS to either of Wait-and Scan or immediate radiosurgery.

The primary study endpoint is the relative tumor size measured as the ratio between tumor volume at four years compared with volume at inclusion. Secondary endpoints include symptom and sign development measured by clinical examination and by patient's responses to standardised validated questionnaires. In addition, the health economics involved with both strategies will be evaluated and compared, as well as the patient's working status.

Patients will be asked to participate if their VS is diagnosed within the last six months, their age is between 18 and 70, and pending there are no exclusion criteria (see below). A power analysis indicates that about 50 patients per group is sufficient.

In case of failure to recruit patients, we will change the design to a study based on patient's own choice of treatment.

The study will be announced according to international guidelines. A steering committee will monitor the study and an intermediate analysis will be performed when the study group has been followed for two years. If the effect aim is already observed, the study should nonetheless continue, as it is too early to evaluate the results after such a short time course.

It will also be discussed to do a follow-up of all patients ten years after inclusion."

NCT02383004,Other,Acupuncture for the Prevention of Emergence Delirium in Children Undergoing Myringotomy Tube Placement,"Myringotomy tube placement is one of the most commonly performed operations in children. Emergence delirium after such procedures is common. During emergence delirium children can become both a danger to themselves and others around them, including family members and hospital staff.

The primary objective of this study is to determine if acupuncture, when used in combination with standard anesthetic management, decreases the incidence of emergence delirium in pediatric patients following myringotomy tube placement. Patients with and without premedication of midazolam will be included. A secondary objective of this study is to determine our institution's actual incidence of emergence delirium for this operation using a validated scale, the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) scale. We will also compare rates of emergence delirium in patients that received a premedication of midazolam versus (V) those that did not (NV).

This is a randomized double-blinded trial. We will enroll 100 children aged 1-6 years old. Premedication with midazolam will be decided by the anesthesiologist. If needed, the patient will receive a standard does of oral midazolam plus acetaminophen (V). If the patient does not require premedication with midazolam, oral acetaminophen will be given alone (NV).

Patients will then be randomized to receive either acupuncture with standard general anesthesia care (A) or to receive standard anesthetic care alone (S). Patients, their family members and recovery registered nurses (RNs) will not know if acupuncture was performed. Intraoperative anesthetic techniques will be standardized and include inhaled inductions with nitrous oxide and sevoflurane. Anesthesia maintenance will be inhaled sevoflurane and the usual pain medication ketorolac will be given intramuscularly prior to emergence. Acupuncture needles will be placed after anesthesia induction and removed prior to leaving the operating room. A total of 4 needles will be placed, one in each wrist at the Heart 7 (HT7) point and one in each ear at the Shen Men point. The needles will be inserted bilaterally to a depth of 1.8 mm.

In the PACU, a blinded study observer will evaluate the patient at four time points using the PAED scale: time of awakening and 5, 10 & 15 minutes after awakening. Follow up phone calls will be made one day and one week after surgery. Families will be asked about behavior after discharge, sleep and bed-wetting."
NCT02541032,Procedure,PeRiodontal Treatment to Eliminate Minority InEquality and Rural Disparities in Stroke,"The PREMIERS study is a proposal for conducting an adequately powered two center phase III randomized controlled trial to test whether intensive periodontal treatment reduces the risk of recurrent vascular events among ischemic stroke and TIA survivors. The study uses the resources in both states including established dental centers, Joint Commission Certified Stroke Centers, the Schools of Public Health, and the Institute for Partnerships to Eliminate Health Disparities. The proposal addresses specific issues with regards to recruitment of African-American and rural stroke/TIA patients advocating the use of culturally appropriate strategies to educate the study subjects regarding stroke, periodontal disease and the periodontal stroke link.

The study proposes to utilize economic evaluation of the periodontal intervention from the budgetary perspective. The focus will be on the financial sustainability of providing aggressive periodontal therapy (with certain, although relatively low expenditures) in exchange for a reduction of uncertain recurrent vascular events that may require high cost emergency department utilization and/or inpatient care. The sustainability of the proposed intervention after the completion of the project is integrally linked to the health economic assessment to show the health care cost savings. By integration with a rural primary care center, with an African American majority and households with average incomes below the state average, the study ensures that the proposed intervention to reduce stroke disparity is applicable to this target population."

NCT03273816,Behavioral,Evaluation of the Benefit Provided by Sessions of Sophrology on the Intraoperative Management of Parkinsonian Patients in the Context of Deep Brain Stimulation Surgery.,"Deep brain stimulation surgery, which consists of intracerebral implantation of electrodes, is considered one of the most effective techniques for controlling the motor fluctuations of Parkinson's disease. The particularity of this surgery is the necessity of the awakening of the patient for the correct positioning of the electrodes, it is therefore a difficult test for the patient.

Medical sophrology is an ideal strategy to optimize the comfort of the patient during the operation thanks to its anxiolytic and analgesic virtues while guaranteeing the maintenance of a good patient vigilance favoring the cooperation with the operating room team. Indeed, sophrology is a body-mediated set of techniques, at the crossroads between hypnosis and yoga, which makes it possible to find a balance between emotions, thoughts and behaviors. It has already been applied in other fields such as oncology, pain management, preparation for childbirth, and for 5 years at the CHU of Rennes for preparation for the intervention of deep brain stimulation."

NCT04500795,Procedure,Prospective Study on the Use of Middle Meningeal Artery Embolization for Chronic Subdural Haematoma,"Subdural haematoma is a common neurosurgical condition that results in different levels of neurological deficits in patients. It can be further classified into acute and chronic, which have different pathophysiology. Acute haematoma is a common result of traumatic injuries involving the tearing of the bridging veins, while chronic subdural haematoma can be both a result of traumatic injuries or recurrence following surgical management of the acute counterpart. For symptomatic patients, they are often surgically managed by haematoma drainage via burr-hole drainage and craniotomy. Recurrent bleeding following close monitor or surgical evacuation of haematoma is however very high. Recent studies approximate the recurrence rate of 2%-33.3%. Recent evidence suggests the angiogenesis of middle meningeal arteries (MMA) in response to inflammation and healing process contributes to the development of chronic subdural haematoma, and its high recurrence chance. Several studies have looked into the use of middle meningeal artery embolization to halt the bleeding of a chronic subdural haematoma, and have found promising results in terms of haematoma reduction and prevention of surgical rescues."

This drug has been shown in laboratory experiments to kill brain tumor cells by causing a so called ""stress response"" in tumor cells. This stress response causes cancer cells to die, but without affecting normal cells. ONC206 alone or in combination with radiation therapy may be effective in treating newly diagnosed or recurrent diffuse midline gliomas and other recurrent primary malignant CNS tumors."
NCT04816799,Behavioral,Efficacy of START (Startle Rehabilitation Therapy) in the Treatment Stroke-induced Aphasia/Apraxia,"A stratified, parallel-group, double-blind, randomized controlled trial of remotely delivered START treatment to individuals with severe-to-moderate stroke (with recruitment focused on individuals with low SES) will be conducted. Subjects and assessors will be blinded to the condition making the experiment double blind. Specifically, subjects will be told that we are exploring a new therapy that using different sounds to improve therapy. Parallel group design will ensure that subjects in the Control group are unaware that their ""sounds"" are softer than the START group. Trainers may become aware that a loud sound is present thus a unique Assessor will evaluate clinical performance before and after training making the study double-blind. Fifty-four subjects will undergo baseline testing in the laboratory to establish their capacity for functional and expressive speech as well as their self-reported health-related quality of life (power analysis below). Next, subjects will participate in a high-frequency, word-picture verification/ auditory-repetition treatment, 2 hr/day for 5 consecutive days focusing on expression of words of functional significance (e.g., water, fall). Subjects will either receive training with START or without (Control). Subjects will be re-tested immediately following training as well as one-month post to assess retention. Aim 1 will evaluate capacity of START to enhance SLT outcomes by assessing the % change in clinical assessment of functional and expressive speech. Our preliminary data points to a robust response [details]. Aim 2 will focus on the capacity of these changes to 1) be retained and 2) impact subject's reported quality of life. NOTE: While we are planning in-person baseline, end, and retention testing, in response to COVID, we have established remote clinical screening using peer-reviewed validated techniques for WAB and ABA-2 (see Alternative Solutions). All preliminary data collected for this proposal were collected remotely via no-contact protocols."
NCT04844333,Other,Effect of Extubation Under Deep Anesthesia on Emergence Agitation of Nasal Surgery,"This study analyzed the relationship between extubation timing and Emergence agitation in 18-60 years old adults undergoing nasal surgery, such as nasal septum correction, endoscopic sinus surgery, and nasal bone fracture reduction. The number of agitation, sedation score, pain score, operation method, analgesic drugs and other data were recorded to analyze the effect of deep anesthesia extubation on agitation in patients with nasal surgery. It also provides a clinical basis for the prevention and treatment of agitation during the recovery period of such operations in adults."
NCT05008302,Procedure,Age and Body Position on Handgrip Strength and Movement Coordination of Upper Limb,The aim of the study was to analyze the importance of the position of the body and the examined upper limb on the parameters of movement coordination and hand grip strength in various age groups of people after a stroke and healthy individuals.
NCT05122650,Other,"A Phase 2b, 12-week, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Randomized, Parallel Group, Multicenter Study of the Safety and Efficacy of JZP385 in the Treatment of Adults With Moderate to Severe Essential Tremor","This is a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel-group, multicenter study of the safety and efficacy of JZP385 in the treatment of adult participants with moderate to severe ET."
NCT05318079,Behavioral,Telehealth Virtual Reality Exergaming and Peer Networking Among People With Spinal Cord Injury,This pilot feasibility study aims to test whether youth and adults with spinal cord injury can use a group virtual reality gaming intervention to exercise. A second purpose is to examine whether there are potential benefits to cardiometabolic health and psychosocial health.
NCT05516342,Behavioral,LEAD IT! An App to Enable Persons With Early Stage Dementia to Lead Group Activities for Their Peers,"The proposed Phase 2 project will involve the further development and evaluation of LEAD IT!, which is a tablet-based app designed to enable persons with dementia to lead activities for their peers (i.e., other persons with dementia). The study will examine the clinical outcomes of long-term use of the app by both Resident Leaders (RLs) and Resident Players (RPs).

The Specific Aims of the proposed Phase 2 project are to:

Develop improved Beta 1 and Beta 2 Versions of LEAD IT! with sufficient content to facilitate six activities twice per week for 4.5 months.
Examine the extent to which RLs are able to serve as leaders while using LEAD IT!
Examine the effects of resident-led LEAD IT! programming on RPs.
Examine PWD and staff satisfaction with LEAD IT!"
NCT05635968,Radiation,The Multicenter Phase II Clinical Trial for Evaluation of Safety and Efficacy Using Low Dose Irradiation With Alzheimer's Disease,"This is a phase II, multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled trial to treat patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) using low-dose irradiation (LDIR). This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of LDIR to whole brain in patients with AD and to determine the potentially applicable radiation dose."
NCT05658731,Radiation,Cognitive Outcomes After Brain Substructure-informed Radiation Planning in Pediatric Patients,"The goal of this trial is to see if it is possible to better plan how radiation therapy is delivered to different parts of the brain in children who require radiation to treat their tumor, and if this will help reduce neurocognitive (thinking and learning) impairments in these patients.

Patients with newly diagnosed brain or head and neck tumors who are having radiation therapy will have neurocognitive testing and MRI imaging (both research and for regular care) done as part of their participation in the study.

Survivors of childhood brain tumors who completed radiation therapy at least two years before joining the study, and have not had a recurrence, will have neurocognitive testing and research MRIs completed.

Healthy children will also be enrolled and have research MRIs done.

The researchers will use the radiation plan to determine how much radiation was delivered to different parts of the brain. The investigators will use the MRIs to determine how the normal brain is changing after treatment; and how this compares to patients who had standard radiation treatment or who never had a brain tumor. The neurocognitive testing will be compared among different groups to see how different treatment plans affect performance on neurocognitive tests."
