All patients underwent polysomnography with MAD in situ to evaluate the effect of the MAD on severity of sleep apnea. If the results of the polysomnography with MAD are unsuccessful (defined as a reduction in AHI with the MAD in situ of less than 50% compared to baseline), the therapy needs to be adjusted. Finding the most effective protrusion should be a weighted compromise between efficacy and side-effects of MAD therapy.

In patients with insufficient results on the polysomnography with the MAD at 75% of maximal protrusion, the MAD will be further adjusted until 90% of the maximal protrusion measured at the follow-up visit after the polysomnography with the MAD.

Given that, Physical Therapy (PT) studies the human movement and its dysfunctions, and that FS, because of its complex chronic characteristic, impairs the affected individual's activities causing movement disorders, a PT professional must be part of the multidisciplinary team involved in the FS treatment. Nonetheless, as explained in the present proposal, several aspects still need clarification related to the PT role in this syndrome. Particularly, studies that analyze the biomechanical, sensorial and cardiorespiratory adaptations in individuals who undergo PT intervention still lack; those studies would contribute with scientific evidence to the clinical practice. According to recent systematic reviews, one of the most used therapies with positive effects on FS subjects is the hydrotherapy, which combines exercises and the water relaxing effects. Other alternative treatments have also been searched, in an attempt to decrease the painful picture presented, as the FS etiology and pathophysiology are not well known. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of different physical therapy resources in the FS, in two subprojects. The first will verify if hydrotherapy is effective in modifying movement variables (scapular kinematics and electromyography) and autonomic modulation. Other variables, such as pain level and quality of life in women with FS, will also be analyzed. The second study will evaluate the efficacy of the Shiatsu massage on pain, sleep quality, balance and quality of life of subjects with FS.",Fibromyalgia,Other,Hydrotherapy

The primary objective of this pilot study is to determine whether PEMF treatment (PEMF+) reduces the magnitude and duration of the increase in CSF and blood biomarkers after traumatic brain injury (TBI) compared to a PEMF untreated (PEMF-) group. Values in both groups are compared to uninjured brain CSF and blood biomarker levels obtained from hydrocephalus patients undergoing ventriculo-peritoneal shunt placement. A secondary objective of this pilot study is to determine whether PEMF treatment improves the physiologic status of the brain as evaluated by brain tissue monitors of thermal dilution cerebral blood flow (CBF), intracranial pressure (ICP), and tissue PO2 (PbtO2). Improved physiologic status would be reflected by increased CBF, PbtO2, and reduced ICP. Improved physiologic status may also be inferred from derived variables reflecting improved cerebrovascular and intracranial pressure autoregulation.

A tertiary objective of this pilot study is to obtain preliminary data on the relationship between the time course and magnitude of post-TBI CSF and blood biomarker levels as they relate to three month outcome by Glasgow outcome score extended (GOSE) and modified Rankin Score (mRS).",Traumatic Brain Injury,Device,SofPulse

NCT03079960,2017-04-04,2021-12-30,Not Applicable,Data-Driven Characterization of Neuronal Markers During Deep Brain Stimulation for Patients With Parkinson's Disease,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) has developed into a standard therapy in the refractory stage of Parkinson's disease (PD). Implanted micro- and macroelectrodes can be used to derive neural signals from the basal ganglia (BG). Cortical signals can be obtained by measurements of the electroencephalogram (EEG) or the electrocorticogram (ECoG). Both signal types can be used to characterize the motor system of the patient and make it possible to estimate the effectiveness of a currently performed DBS. However, the relationship between such neuronal features on the one hand and the DBS stimulation parameters or the observable clinical effects on the other hand is very individual and varies from patient to patient.

The aim of the present study is to: (1) determine neuronal characteristics that are informative about the clinically relevant motor status of PD patients. (2) The investigation and description of the complex non-stationary dynamics of neuronal characteristics as a consequence of changing DBS stimulation parameters. (3) The study of the effect of changing DBS stimulation parameters on motor performance.

The three objectives form an important building block for future adaptive closed-loop DBS strategies (aDBS). Here, the stimulation parameters are to be adapted in the single-trial and depending on the currently detected motor state of the patient. Since this is accessible only to a very limited extent, it is to be investigated whether information about the motor state can be obtained from the neural features.",Parkinson Disease,Device,Electrophysiological recording and measurement devices

An interesting feature observed in some patients is a regenerative process, called remyelination, which leads to the production of new myelin. However, the extent of remyelination is very heterogeneous among patients, only a minority of patients show a really efficient repair process along the disease course. In this project, our aim is to explore in vivo the biological mechanisms leading to a successful remyelination in some patients and to a failure in remyelination in others. With this purpose in mind we propose to develop a translational research platform where patients with multiple sclerosis will be investigated in vivo for their potential of remyelination through a follow-up with recently developed imaging technologies using a synergistic combination of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) to visualize and quantify myelin and neuroinflammation. In parallel blood immune cells from patients will be sampled and profiled to investigate how they could influence remyelination. This part will consist in i) grafting patients' lymphocytes in experimental rodent models of demyelination to characterize how they could promote or inhibit remyelination; ii) performing a functional and multi-omics analysis of peripheral macrophages and analyse relationships with remyelination profiles; iii) profiling T lymphocytes at the single cell level to associate specific subpopulation of the T cells with the remyelination potential assessed in patients with MRI/PET images and in grafted animals.",Multiple Sclerosis,Procedure,PET-MRI with [18F]-Florbetaben and PET-MRI with [18F]-DPA-714

The investigators will recruit also 20 age-matched healthy controls (H-CO) as additional control group who will not perform the HIIT. All PD subjects will be examined during their medication ""OFF-phase"" pre HIIT and 1 week-, 1 month-POST cycle of HIIT. The subject from H-CO will be tested only once. To examine the assumed HIIT-induced changes in brain functioning the investigators will use: (i) EEG (recorded simultaneously with EMG) methods to assess an amplitude, location and directionality of brain electrical current of cortical regions and strength of intra-cortical network interactions during motor tasks performance.

The results of the study will help to answer the fundamental questions about HIIT induced neuroplasticity in PD patients, as well as complement the lack in knowledge about the mechanisms of exercise-induced changes in PD, and as a consequence it could enrich the golden standard of treatment in PD from pharmacotherapy toward implementation of precise evidence based rehabilitation.",Parkinson Disease,Behavioral,exercise

All PD subjects will be examined during their medication ""OFF-phase"" pre HIIT and 1 week-, 1 month-POST cycle of HIIT. The subject from H-CO will be tested only once. To examine the assumed HIIT-induced changes in brain functioning the investigators will use: (i) EEG (recorded simultaneously with EMG) methods to assess an amplitude, location and directionality of brain electrical current of cortical regions and strength of intra-cortical network interactions during motor tasks performance. During the EEG experiments the subjects will perform (i) bimanual anti-phase DA level dependent motor tasks (during which the investigators will record EMG, force). The investigators will also assess motor and non-motor symptoms of PD and functional test of manual dexterity to evaluate a quality psychomotor behavior.

Using these methods the investigators will determine in detail the mechanisms of functioning of the CNS in PD patients, with emphasis on the cortical interactions that are dependent on synthesis and DA transmission. The results of the study will help to answer the fundamental questions about HIIT induced neuroplasticity in PD patients, as well as complement the lack in knowledge about the mechanisms of exercise-induced changes in PD, and as a consequence it could enrich the golden standard of treatment in PD from pharmacotherapy toward implementation of precise evidence based rehabilitation.",Physical Activity,Behavioral,conventional physical therapy
NCT00173992,2005-09-30,2007-12-31,Not Applicable,Balance Recovery and Training on Fall Prevention in Stroke,"The specific aims of this research are delineated as the following:

Aim 1: To investigate the neuromuscular and biomechanical mechanisms of the emerging processes of proactive and reactive balance control during sitting and standing in patients with stroke at different stages of the recovery course.

Aim 2: To determine the relationships between brain lesion sites and the recovery patterns of reactive and proactive balance control mechanisms in patients with stroke.

Aim 3: To determine the relationships between the impairments in reactive and proactive balance control mechanisms and functional outcome as well as fall incidence in patients following stroke.

Aim 4: To investigate the efficacy of different training regimens in improving reactive and proactive balance control strategies and in preventing falls in stroke patients with different brain lesion sites.

Principally, three hypotheses are to be tested:

Hypothesis 1:The emerging processes and recovery patternes of proactive and reactive balance control may be different among stroke patients with different brain lesion locations.

Hypothesis 2:There are positive correlations between the level of impairments in reactive and proactive balance control mechanisms and functional outcome as well as fall incidence in patients following stroke.

Hypothesis 3:Training regimens that could best facilitate the emergence or improvement in reactive and proactive balance control strategies are different.",Stroke,Behavioral,Balance and Exercise

For example, people frequently walk while talking on a cellphone or drive while talking to a passenger. Often, the performance of one or more of these simultaneously performed tasks may deteriorate when another task is carried out at the same time, even in healthy young adults. This reduction in performance is referred to as the DT deficit or DT cost and is typically much higher in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) than in young adults or age-matched controls. In PD, this DT cost impairs the gait pattern, as manifested, for example, in increased gait variability, exacerbating instability and fall risk.

In the proposed study, would be evaluated the effects of tDCS on dual tasking performance following tDCS.

NCT01874782,2013-05-31,2015-07-31,Phase 2,Transcranial Electrical Stimulation for Management of Orthostatic Instability in Acute Cervical Spinal Cord Injury,"Individuals with acute cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) can suffer from an excessive and prolonged fall in blood pressure when assuming an upright position, such as transitioning from lying to sitting or standing, a condition also known as orthostatic hypotension (OH). Due to a decrease in cerebral oxygenation, affected individuals can develop debilitating symptoms including lightheadedness, blurred vision, fatigue and even loss of consciousness. Recent evidence suggests that OH has a negative impact on cognition in individuals with SCI. Clinical observations suggest that OH can lead to neurological deterioration in individuals who may otherwise have a stable SCI. The presence of symptomatic OH prevented participation in 43% of physical therapy treatment sessions in a study of individuals with acute SCI despite the use of current treatment options. OH is known to adversely affect health, delay rehabilitation and prolong hospitalization in the acute phase of management of individuals who display it. Our team found OH was present in 41 of 55 (75%) patients with acute cervical SCI at our center in 2004.

We plan to research the efficacy of a low-cost, non-invasive device known as transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) to manage OH in individuals with acute cervical SCI. Previous studies have shown that this device is safe to use in individuals with SCI, and has improved blood pressure control in non-SCI individuals.

We hypothesize that in individuals with acute cervical SCI and OH, TES intervention will elicit an attenuation of the drop in systolic BP (SBP)in response to orthostatic stress.

Because these devices are commercially available, there is nothing theoretically stopping these participants from purchasing their own machine. Therefore, we have chosen to carry out a longitudinal study that will allow us to serve as an advisory role for participants who have decided to continue administering tDCS at home. We will recommend the tDCS related items that should be purchased, and train participants on how to properly administer tDCS.

NCT03967626,2019-11-27,2023-11-27,Not Applicable,Practical Efficiency of Coupling Targeted Temperature Management to Brain Temperature Rather Than Systemic Temperature in Severe Brain Injury (BRAIN TTM),"In severe brain-injured patients, it is recommended to strictly control the fever in order to limit brain damage (objective of neuroprotection) via the targeted temperature management (TTM). In the guidelines, the target temperature is the systemic temperature, just for practical reasons (brain temperature not being monitored in most polyvalent ICU). However, in NICU, the brain temperature is monitored routinely via the Intra-Cerebral Pressure (ICP) sensor. Since in the febrile brain-injured patients the objective of the TTM is neuroprotection, it would be more appropriate to target temperature control over the cerebral temperature.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of TTM directly coupled to the brain temperature.

Adult patients with brain injury requiring ICP monitoring (Pressio 2, Sophysa France) and fever requiring TTM (cerebral greater than or equal to 38.5 °C) will be enrolled. The TTM will be carried out according to the usual methods of the investigator's service: external cooling devices coupled with cerebral temperature (Artic Sun, Bard France), including two phases: the cooling phase (H0 to H3) and the maintenance phase (from H3 to the end of the cooling).

Two groups will be formed. In the interventional group, coupling of the TTM will be carried out to the cerebral temperature. In the control group, coupling of the TTM will be carried out to the systemic temperature measured at the bladder site.

The primary outcome will be the percentage of time during which the cerebral temperature will be measured within recommended target temperature range (i.e. 36 to 37 °C) during the maintenance phase (H3 to H12): comparison of averages. Cerebral hemodynamic parameters (ICP, transcranial doppler, and brain tissue oxygen partial pressure if available) will also be collected, in order to be correlated with the delta temperature (cerebral temperature minor systemic temperature).

No medical device will be put in place specifically for the need of the study.",Brain Injuries,Device,external cooling with the xxxxx device

NCT05004194,2021-03-19,2021-07-02,Not Applicable,Vestibular Caloric Stimulation and the Modulation of Pain in Fibromyalgia: An Open Label Pilot Study,"The management of chronic pains is challenging and fraught with limitations. Fibromyalgia is a common pain disorder characterized by chronic widespread pains, associated with fatigue and impaired quality of life. Fibromyalgia affects millions of people and is among the most common reasons for consulting with a rheumatologist. The food and drug administration (FDA) approved three medications to treat fibromyalgia, though there are many patients for whom these medications are ineffective, poorly tolerated or cost-prohibitive. Accordingly, there exists a need for novel therapeutics.

The researchers would like to test the therapeutic efficacy of a non-pharmacologic non-interventional bedside technique called vestibular caloric stimulation (VCS). VCS, irrigating the external ear canal with water, is a simple, non-invasive, cost-free procedure with preliminary data suggesting potential for improving pain. VCS is a form of neuromodulation and there are anatomically defined pathways elucidated to help explain how this works. There currently exists limited data on the topic, only case reports and case series. Given a clear need for additional therapeutics in many patients with fibromyalgia, the researchers have elected to conduct this trial.",Fibromyalgia,Procedure,Vestibular Caloric Stimulation

NCT02879591,2014-04-30,2016-09-30,Not Applicable,Enhancing Social Interaction With an AlterEgo Artificial Agent,"The objective of AlterEgo is the creation of an interactive cognitive architecture, implementable in various artificial agents, allowing a continuous interaction with patients suffering from social disorders, by virtue of changes in behavioural (robot-based) as well as morphological (avatar-based) properties of that agent. The project includes research in fundamental and clinical neurosciences, interaction modeling, development of new computer-vision techniques and human-robot interfaces, as well as evaluation of the scenarios with patients before, during, and after training sessions. At the end of the project, the investigators will produce a new avatar-based clinical method able to enhance social interaction of patients.

The first challenge of this project is to create an avatar alter ego of a patient. Based on recent work in social robotics and neurosciences, the investigators hypothesize that if patients face artificial agents morphologically and behaviourally similar to them, they will increase their social interaction. The second challenge is to transform the morphology and the behaviour of the similar artificial agent into that of a healthy and different agent. The investigators assume that the smooth and continuous behavioural shift from similar/unhealthy to complementary/healthy social behaviour will lead to a better social rehabilitation. AlterEgo opens the door to a new generation of social artificial agents in service robotics. AlterEgo is an interdisciplinary project at the interaction of Social Motor Neurosciences (UM1), Robotics (EPFL), Complex Systems Dynamics (UOB), Computer Vision (DFKI), and Psychiatry (CHU).

NCT03517657,2018-01-20,2024-03-30,Not Applicable,Bilateral Priming Plus Task Specific Training for Severe Upper Limb Hemiparesis,"The purpose of the study is to determine the best treatment for the arm that has been affected by a stroke. The investigators plan to determine if the arm affected by a stroke will improve with a combination of motor priming and motor training. Motor priming provides a warm up for the brain so that the brain and body will better respond to treatment. There are two types of priming in this study. One is called bilateral motor priming which involves using both hands. Bilateral priming requires that the individual make continuous wrist movements in a low-tech gadget called the Exsurgo primer, a piece of equipment in which each hand goes between two plates that are connected together so that the stronger wrist moves the weaker wrist in and out at the same time. The second type of priming includes use of low intensity stimulation for your affected arm. The investigators expect the bilateral priming group will have more improvement. The study team anticipates enrolling approximately 76 individuals with stroke at Northwestern University and Shirley Ryan AbilityLab into this study. Each participant will have 24 visits. Nine visits will be for evaluation and fifteen for therapy. Each visit will be two to three hours depending on the type of visit and tests being done. Participants who are eligible and want to participate in this study will be randomized (selected by chance) to one of the two groups. The possible groups are: 1) bilateral priming plus motor training and 2) electrical stimulation priming and motor training. Participants are not blinded. Evaluation sessions consist of three separate days of testing and will occur at three time points: (1) before treatment starts; (2) after treatment is completed; and (3) 8 weeks later (follow-up evaluation: visits 22-24). There are three motor assessments, the Neuro-QOL (short form), and an evaluation of cortical excitability using TMS. After a stroke, there is often an imbalance of excitability between the affected and less affected parts of the brain. The imbalance will be measured using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), a technique used in neurorehabilitation research. TMS will not be used for treatment. There will also be a grip termination evaluation.

Disturbances in these protective mechanisms increase the risk of aspiration pneumonia. In fact, aspiration pneumonia is the leading cause of death in individuals with PD. Expiratory muscle strength training (EMST) studies have reported significant improvements in the field of airway protective therapies. EMST represents a treatment that can be quantified and translated into functional outcomes that can directly improve functions related to coughing, swallowing, and speech in patients with PD. However, information about detraining outcomes presented in Troche et al. 2014 highlights the need for the development of long-term maintenance programs to sustain training gains following intensive periods of EMST, especially considering the progressive nature of PD. Low long-term adherence to home exercise is an important issue in many patient groups and may compromise treatment outcomes. In patients with PD, this is further compounded by a wide variety of neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as apathy and depression. Therefore, we developed a mobile phone-based visual feedback application (SpiroGym app.) to keep patients motivated to continue EMST following intensive periods of training. The usability of a SpiroGym app was tested in individuals with PD and the findings indicate that EMST coupled with SpiroGym app is feasible and potentially useful in PD patients.

The usability of a SpiroGym app was tested in individuals with PD and the findings indicate that EMST coupled with SpiroGym app is feasible and potentially useful in PD patients. Present study aims to verify and extend the encouraging results of this study which showed a potential self-efficacy benefit of the SpiroGym application.",Parkinson Disease,Device,Expiratory muscle strength training

The study will include free play-based behavioral intervention that may improve social and communication skills in children with TSC. Eligible families will have a child in the age range of 12-36 months, with a diagnosis of TSC. A parent must also be available to attend the weekly intervention sessions at UCLA.

The intervention will focus on teaching caregivers skills to improve the social and communication outcomes of their children. The content of the intervention will be individually tailored to the child's developmental level. The intervention involves pre-assessments, an intervention period of daily 60 minute sessions for 10 days, followed by weekly 60 minute sessions for 10 weeks, and post-assessments. The classroom can have up to 3 parent-child dyad and the curriculum focuses on improving social-communication and play skills.",Tuberous Sclerosis Complex,Behavioral,JASPER

Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a genetic form of childhood obesity that is characterized by hypotonia, growth hormone deficiency, behavioral, and cognitive disability. In children, the low prevalence of PWS (1 in 10,000 to 15,000 live births) makes group-based physical activity (PA) interventions impossible. In contrast, the home environment presents a natural venue to establish a PA routine for this population. The present high prevalence of non-syndromal childhood obesity (one in four) and high physical inactivity rates, make alternative approaches to increasing PA in this population an area of high interest. Therefore, we have developed a 24-week home-based physical activity that could be suitable for children and adolescents ages 8-15 with PWS as well as obese children without PWS ages 8-11 years. It is hypothesized that: 1) an age-appropriate 24-week home-based PA intervention will increase PA levels in youth with PWS and without the syndrome but with obesity; 2) motor proficiency, central sensory reception and integration, and body composition will significantly improve in youth with and without PWS following completion of the home-based PA intervention and 3) physical activity self-efficacy and quality of life will increase significantly in youth with and without PWS who complete the home-based PA intervention. The study participants are 115 youth ages 8-15 y (45 with PWS and 70 without PWS but categorized as obese). The study utilizes a parallel design with the wait-listed control group receiving the intervention after serving as control. Participants are expected to complete the PA curriculum 4 days a week for six months including playground games 2 days a week and interactive console games 2 days a week. Parents are trained at baseline and then provided with a PA curriculum (Active Play at Home) and equipment to guide their implementation of the program at home. Measurements of children and parent dyads are assessed at baseline and at the end (week 24) of the intervention or control periods.

In people with chronic stroke, one of the most common and disabling problems is spasticity (increased muscle tone or muscle stiffness). The purpose of this research study is to examine effects of dry needling on the nervous system (pathways between the muscle, spinal cord, and brain) in people with spasticity due to chronic stroke. Dry needling is a procedure in which a thin, stainless steel needle is inserted into the skin to produce a muscle twitch response. It is intended to release a knot in the muscle and relieve pain.

The total study duration is 7 visits over 2 weeks. There will be 4 visits the first week, and 3 visits the second week. The first visit will take about 1.5 hours, during which study staff will determine the best placement of electrodes and create a cast of the participant's leg to aid them in quickly placing the electrodes on the remainder of the visits. The second and fifth visits will last about 3.5 hours, and all other visits will last about 1.5 hours. Dry needling will take place on the fifth visit only.

NCT03941119,2019-05-06,2020-03-16,Not Applicable,VRx: Randomized Controlled Trial to Evaluate the Impact of Virtual Reality Therapy on Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms and Quality of Life of Individuals With Dementia Admitted to an Acute Care Hospital,"Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) (such as aggression, restlessness, agitation, wandering, anxiety, depression) are common to most people with dementia at some point during their illness and represent an aspect of dementia particularly difficult to manage. There is growing attention to the therapeutic effects of natural environments on people's health. Exposure to natural environments (seeing greenery, hearing outside natural sounds) has been shown to enhance wellbeing, reduce depression, anxiety and stress levels, and decrease hospital length-of-stay for inpatients. Virtual Reality (VR) is a novel technology that uses a Head Mounted Display (HMD) to generate simulated immersive experiences that elicit perceptions and behaviors similar to those in real life and can make one feel as though they are truly present in another place. Based on scientific research, previous studies, and expert consultation, we created a library of VR experiences depicting calming nature scenes designed specifically for people with dementia.

The objectives of this RCT are 1) to evaluate the effects of VR-therapy on BPSD and the hospital care experience of in-patients with dementia and/or delirium admitted to an acute care hospital, 2) to determine the usability, tolerability, and safety of VR-therapy for patients with dementia and/or delirium admitted to acute care, 3) determine the effect of VR-therapy on quality of life for patients with dementia and/or delirium admitted to acute care and 4) to explore a framework for introducing non-pharmacological therapies in acute care hospitals.

Our hypotheses are 1) VR-therapy helps manage BPSD (e.g. decrease anxiety, aggression, depression, violent behaviors, incidents of wandering), and may decrease the amount and/or frequency of sedatives and anti-depressant medication administered and/or the number of incidents that require restraints, and the number of falls, in people with dementia and/or delirium admitted to an acute care hospital. 2) VR-therapy will improve the quality of life for individuals with dementia and/or delirium admitted to an acute care hospital (operationalized through conducting a validated instrument to measure quality of life for people with dementia). 3) VR-therapy is safe and feasible to administer to individuals with dementia and/or delirium admitted to an acute care hospital (with assistance from their circle of care members and/or caregivers).",Dementia,Other,VR-therapy

New algorithms for motion control involved in encouraging active movement are developed and will be tested, but the study has the same therapeutic goal and focus as the original FEATHERS project of creating an engaging at-home bimanual upper limb training program. By incorporating existing gaming technology, we hope to discover novel ways to adapt commercial motion tracking controllers and visual feedback into engaging rehabilitative learning tools.

Veterans have inevitably been exposed to high levels of sound during military service, and even though they may not yet have NIHL, their ears have been damaged. Continued noise exposure in civilian life will result in NIHL. However, it can easily be prevented by avoiding noise or using hearing protection. Most people are unaware that noise damages hearing, and even when they are, they do not use hearing protection.

Studies have nevertheless shown that walking exercise therapy can improve walking capacity in pwMS. This may be particularly potent if occurring outdoors due to the varying stimuli it can provide (different surfaces and terrain etc.), and if the intensity and duration is adequate. Furthermore, outdoor walking is (1) suitable as a group intervention facilitating interaction between pwMS and (2) advantageous due to the health benefits offered through the interaction with nature itself. Both these aspects are also relevant for well-being.

Few studies have nevertheless examined the effects of outdoor walking exercise therapy in pwMS.

NCT04972071,2023-02-01,2025-02-01,Not Applicable,Multi-Centre Cluster-Randomized Implementation of Canadian Syncope Risk Score Based Practice Recommendations for Emergency Department Syncope Management,"Syncope is a common reason for emergency department (ED) presentation. While often benign, some patients have serious and life-threatening underlying causes, both cardiac and non-cardiac, which may or may not be apparent at the time of the initial ED assessment. Identifying which patients will benefit from further investigation, ongoing monitoring and/or hospital admission is essential to reduce both adverse outcomes and high costs. The research team has spent over a decade developing the evidence base for a risk stratification tool directed at optimizing the accuracy of ED decisions: the Canadian Syncope Risk Score (CSRS). This tool is now ready for the final phase of its introduction into clinical practice, namely a robust, multicentre implementation trial of the CSRS-based practice recommendations to demonstrate its real-world effectiveness. These recommendations, if applied, could lead to reduction in hospitalization with only 6% of high-risk patients requiring hospitalization, shorter ED lengths of stay for the 76% of ED syncope patients who are at low risk for 30-day serious outcomes, and more standardized disposition decisions, specifically discharge of 18% of medium-risk patients after appropriate discussion. Hence, the investigators hypothesize that an important reduction in hospitalization and ED disposition time can be achieved by implementing the CSRS-based recommendations with potential improvements in patient safety. The overall objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the knowledge translation (KT) of the CSRS-based practice recommendations in multiple Canadian EDs using a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial (SW-CRT) on health care efficiency and patient safety.",Syncope,Other,Knowledge translation (KT) of the CSRS based practice recommendations

NCT02525640,2015-08-01,2017-02-01,Not Applicable,Hearing Handicap in Patients With Single Sided Deafness,"Single sided deafness (SSD) refers to asymmetrical hearing loss, where there is a significant worsening of hearing in one ear compared to the other.

In Cambridge, the investigators see large numbers of patients with SSD caused by vestibular schwannomas, due to their affiliation with the Neuro-Otology Department, with over 100 new SSD patients being referred every year.

Only a small number of studies have explored hearing handicap for those with SSD, and music appreciation has not been investigated, to the best of the investigators knowledge, in this patient group.

In the limited number of studies conducted on those with single sided deafness, often only one or two outcome measures have been used, or the patient group has been small. The investigators have a large group of patients with a wide range of aetiologies who have completed several questionnaires as part of their treatment in the single sided deafness clinic and the investigators would like to analyse these data.

At present there are different devices available on the NHS for the management of SSD and many studies have explored benefits of Bone Anchored Hearing Aids (BAHA). There is an under-representation of studies looking specifically at CROS aid devices which is relevant given the cost differences involved between devices.

Study goals and objectives

To find out what factors drive hearing handicap in SSD patients by analysing the results of several different well validated hearing handicap questionnaires
To find out whether or not it is possible to change hearing handicap in this patient group by looking to see if there is an improvement in questionnaire scores post treatment.
The investigators will also look at a sub-group who will be fitted with both traditional wired CROS aids and more up-to-date wireless aids which have been funded through a research grant, in order to assess whether these are more beneficial.
The investigators will use a new questionnaire developed in-house to further explore the impact of single sided deafness on music appreciation.",Hearing Loss,Device,Hearing Aid

NCT04235374,2020-10-19,2025-01-31,Not Applicable,Testing the Efficacy of FFC-AC-EIT in Patients With Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias,"Older adults with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) comprise approximately 25% of hospitalized older adults. These individuals are at increased risk for functional decline, delirium, falls, behavioral symptoms associated with dementia (BPSD) and longer lengths of stay. Physical activity during hospitalization (e.g., mobility,bathing, dressing) has a positive impact on older adults including prevention of functional decline, less pain, less delirium, less BPSD, fewer falls, shorter length of stay and decreased unplanned hospital readmissions. Despite known benefits, physical activity is not routinely encouraged and older hospitalized patients spend over 80% of their acute care stay in bed. Challenges to increasing physical activity among older patients with ADRD include environment and policy issues (e.g., lack of access to areas to walk); lack of knowledge among nurses on how to evaluate, prevent and manage delirium and BPSD; inappropriate use of tethers; beliefs among patients, families, and nurses that bed rests helps recovery and prevents falls; and lack of motivation/willingness of patients to get out of bed. To increase physical activity and prevent functional decline while hospitalized we developed Function Focused Care for Acute Care (FFC-AC-EIT) for patients with ADRD. Implementation of FFC-AC-EIT changes how care is provided by having nurses teach, cue, and help patients with ADRD engage in physical activity during all care interactions. FFC-AC-EIT was developed using a social ecological model, social cognitive theory and the Evidence Integration Triangle.

Aim 1 will focus on efficacy at the patient level based primarily on physical activity, function, and participation in function focused care, and secondarily on delirium, BPSD, pain, falls, use of tethers, and length of stay; and all of these outcomes (except length of stay and tethers) along with emergency room visits, re-hospitalizations and new long term care admissions at 1, 6 and 12 months post discharge; and at the unit level the aim is to evaluate the impact of FFC-AC-EIT on policies and environments that facilitate function and physical activity at 6, 12 and 18 months post implementation. Hospitals randomized to FFC-AC-EIT will be compared with those randomized to Function Focused Care Education Only (EO). Aim 2 will evaluate the feasibility, based on treatment fidelity (delivery, receipt, enactment)136, and relative cost and cost savings of FFC-AC-EIT versus EO. Findings will address several prioritized areas of research: a focus on ADRD; improving physical function; and training of hospital staff and will demonstrate efficacy of an approach to care for patients with ADRD that can be disseminated and implemented across all acute care facilities.",Dementia,Behavioral,FFC-AC-EIT
NCT04235374,2020-10-19,2025-01-31,Not Applicable,Testing the Efficacy of FFC-AC-EIT in Patients With Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias,"Older adults with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) comprise approximately 25% of hospitalized older adults. These individuals are at increased risk for functional decline, delirium, falls, behavioral symptoms associated with dementia (BPSD) and longer lengths of stay. Physical activity during hospitalization (e.g., mobility,bathing, dressing) has a positive impact on older adults including prevention of functional decline, less pain, less delirium, less BPSD, fewer falls, shorter length of stay and decreased unplanned hospital readmissions. Despite known benefits, physical activity is not routinely encouraged and older hospitalized patients spend over 80% of their acute care stay in bed. Challenges to increasing physical activity among older patients with ADRD include environment and policy issues (e.g., lack of access to areas to walk); lack of knowledge among nurses on how to evaluate, prevent and manage delirium and BPSD; inappropriate use of tethers; beliefs among patients, families, and nurses that bed rests helps recovery and prevents falls; and lack of motivation/willingness of patients to get out of bed. To increase physical activity and prevent functional decline while hospitalized we developed Function Focused Care for Acute Care (FFC-AC-EIT) for patients with ADRD. Implementation of FFC-AC-EIT changes how care is provided by having nurses teach, cue, and help patients with ADRD engage in physical activity during all care interactions. FFC-AC-EIT was developed using a social ecological model, social cognitive theory and the Evidence Integration Triangle.

NCT02729766,2016-03-31,2016-08-31,Phase 2/Phase 3,Effects of Empagliflozin an SGLT2-Inhibitor on Healthy Volunteers With Induced Hypotonic Hyponatremia - the DIVE Study,"Empagliflozin (Jardiance)® is a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2)-Inhibitor, which is a new treatment option developed for patients with diabetes mellitus type 2. The SGLT2 is expressed in the proximal tubule and reabsorbs approximately 90 percent of the filtered glucose. The inhibition of SGLT2 results in renal excretion of glucose with subsequent osmotic diuresis. This mechanism could result in a therapeutic effect in patients with hypotonic hyponatremia as in the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion (SIAD). Because patients with SIAD usually have several comorbidities and different medications, studies investigating the physiological effects are difficult to interpret. Therefore a model to study the possible physiological effect of SGLT2-inhibitors in hypotonic hyponatremia as in SIAD is needed.

The aim of this study is to evaluate whether empagliflozin (Jardiance)® has an effect on serum sodium levels of healthy volunteers with induced hypotonic hyponatremia.",Inappropriate ADH Syndrome,Other,Induced hypotonic hyponatremia - SIAD model

A Pilot Study.,"Is Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) feasible and acceptable for adults with severe Traumatic Brain Injury (sTBI) in inpatient services? sTBI is associated with depression, anxiety and low self awareness. A key factor in recovery is adjustment to the effects of injury. Psychological intervention may facilitate this change; however what works is unclear. ACT seeks to improve psychological flexibility; the ability to be present with difficult thoughts and emotions, rather than fighting them, and to accept ourselves as we are, not what we believe we should be. Current research is limited, but what is published suggests it may be useful for this group.

Due to the limited research this pilot study aims to conduct preliminary analysis on the acceptability and feasibility of ACT for people with sTBI whilst also examining the suitability of the study protocol in order to make recommendations for future studies. Clients and staff from three Brain Injury Rehabilitation Trust (BIRT) centres will be recruited, one of which will serve as the intervention centre.

Clients in the intervention group will be asked to complete questionnaires a week before and after participation in the 6 week ACT programme. Clients in the comparison group will be asked to complete questionnaires a week before and after receiving 6 weeks of treatment as usual (TAU). The treatment group will also receive TAU. All participants will be invited to participate in a focus group at the end of this 8 week period to discuss their involvement in the study.

NCT00475748,2007-05-31,2010-05-31,Phase 2,"ASIA Motor, Functional and Health Related Quality of Life Outcome in Traumatic Central Cord Syndrome, a Prospective Randomized Study","ABSTRACT/EXECUTIVE SUMMARY BACKGROUND, SIGNIFICANCE & RATIONALE: Between 10-20% of the more than 6000 cases of spinal cord injury seen annually in the North America have the clinical pattern of traumatic central cord syndrome (TCCS). These patients are usually older, most likely have sustained a fall, and have incomplete spinal cord injury characterized by dysesthetic and weak upper extremities. CT scan of the cervical spine in patients with TCCS often shows disc/osteophytes complex superimposed on degenerative or congenital spinal stenosis and MRI reveals signal changes at one or multiple skeletal segments. A minority of these patients suffer from fracture/subluxations, however, this group of patients are younger and have been involved in a more dynamic trauma. Since 1951, when Schneider et al reported this syndrome, controversy has dominated its surgical management. The current ""Guidelines for the Management of Acute Cervical Spine and Spinal Cord Injuries"" recommendations are only at the level of options, since prospective outcome data are unavailable.

HYPOTHESIS: in acute traumatic central cord syndrome, surgical decompression of the spinal cord within five days will result in more rapid motor recovery, than decompression 6 weeks following injury. To test this hypothesis, we will pursue the following specific aims:

SPECIFIC AIM I: To compare American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Motor Scores after three months post injury in patients with central cord syndrome operated on within five days of injury to a similar group of patients operated on 6 weeks following injury.

SPECIFIC AIM II: To compare functional outcome, health related quality of life and posttraumatic syrinx size in patients with traumatic central cord syndrome operated on within five days to a similar group of patients operated on 6 weeks following injury.

DESIGN: Single center prospective randomized study. PROCEDURE: In a two-year period thirty patients with traumatic central cord syndrome and cord compression (15 patients in each group) will be randomized to undergo surgical decompression either within the first five days or at 6 weeks following spinal cord injury. ASIA motor, functional recovery and health related quality of life between the two groups will be compared at admission, discharge from rehab facility 3 months and 12 months after surgery.",Central Cord Syndrome,Procedure,Early and late surgery for traumatic central cord syndrome

NCT03787693,2018-07-01,2023-06-30,Not Applicable,Virtual Reality Augmented Gait Adaptation in Stroke Survivors,"The major problem in stroke survivors that is being addressed in this research project is walking asymmetry, i.e., difference between the legs during walking (e.g. steps on the more affected side are longer than the other). A potential solution to this problem is using new technology like virtual reality during walking training to make stroke survivors have a better sense of their asymmetry. A second problem that we aim to address in this study is whether asymmetry is accurately felt by the stroke survivors and how we can address it. Our ongoing work on the effects of virtual reality on learning new walking tasks in stroke survivors indicates that virtual reality maybe particularly important for those with walking asymmetry. In this study, we plan to recruit stroke survivors who have such asymmetries during walking and have them learn a new walking task in virtual reality. We will also test the stroke survivors to determine if there is a relationship between how well they learn the new task with their ability to feel asymmetry accurately.",Stroke,Behavioral,VR - Virtual Reality

NCT01579604,2012-06-30,2019-12-31,Phase 4,Early Nerve Reconstruction Approach in Tetraplegic Patients With Dysfunctional Upper Extremity: a Randomized Controlled Trial.,"The cervical spine is most commonly injured, accounting for 53.4% of spinal injuries. More than 40% of all spinal injuries occur at either C4, C5 or C6 levels leading to variable loss of function in the upper extremities.

Traditionally, patients sustaining a cervical spine injury were followed for 2 years to ensure that recovery had stabilized before offering upper extremity reconstruction. This type of reconstruction includes active muscle transfer, tendon transfer and joint fusion.

Patients are most commonly assessed immediately at the time of injury. Muscle testing is commonly performed using Medical Research Grading System (MRC).

Although complete neurologic stabilization may not be complete until 2 years post-injury, in the group with initial grade 0 muscle strength after the acute phase of injury, expectations of improved muscle strength to or beyond grade 3 after 4-6 months is minimal. And grade 3 muscle strength is felt to be the minimum useful functional strength in a muscle group.

The investigators propose an early nerve reconstruction approach to the tetraplegic patient with dysfunction of the upper extremity to augment the available tendon transfers.

A comparative pilot study is proposed to determine the effectiveness of supinator branch to posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) transfer in 5 patients with cervical spine injury. Patient who fits inclusion criteria will be offered the opportunity to be involved in the study and reviewed at 6 months from injury. If the patient still has not regained Grade 3 power in finger or thumb extension, they will be randomized to be in a surgical group or non-surgical group.

If informed consent is obtained, then surgery will be completed between 6-9 months from the patient's original cervical spine injury. The patient will be followed at regular intervals post-operatively with expectation of 18-24 month follow-up.

Measures will be used pre and post-operatively for comparison. Measures will include MRC muscle grade (EDC), range of motion, Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand Questionnaire (DASH), and The Graded Redefined Assessment of Strength Sensibility and Prehension (GRASSP) (Kalsi-Ryan, 2011).",Tetraplegia,Procedure,Nerve reconstruction

CPAP stabilizes the airway and prevents instability and collapse. With a stable and patent airway, breathing continues in a normal manner, gas exchange is improved, and there is no disruption of sleep related to disturbed breathing.

Auto Servo Ventilation (Auto SV) is a mode of positive airway pressure used to treat obstructive and complex central sleep apnea. The main features of the Auto SV mode include:

Normalization of ventilation by automatically adjusting Inspiratory Positive Airway Pressure (IPAP) pressure to achieve a target ventilation. IPAP is increased or decreased to help stabilize the ventilation.
Provision of timed, back-up breaths during central apneas. The optimal back-up rate is automatically determined by the device based on the patient's breathing.
Automatic control of Expiratory Positive Airway Pressure (EPAP) to treat obstructive events.

Several manufacturers produce these types of devices. The algorithms used to determine the IPAP, EPAP and minimum respiratory rate are different.

NCT02426671,2012-06-30,2012-10-31,Not Applicable,Tinnitus Alleviation Via Sensory Stimulation (Modulation of Tinnitus Through Simultaneous Auditory and Transcutaneous Tactile Stimulation of the Tongue),"The investigators propose that a novel experimental device 'MuteButton' can affect the awareness of tinnitus. Sound that arrives at the ears naturally will be presented in the form of touch patterns on the tongue. By learning to associate the sounds in the ears with the sound patterns on the tongue, the investigators aim to demonstrate that the brain will learn to discriminate the real sounds from legitimate external sounds from the imaginary tinnitus sounds that are created inside the brain. Tinnitus is an audiological condition most commonly described as 'ringing in the ears' that affects an estimated 40 million people globally (American Tinnitus Association; Royal National Institute for Deaf). More accurately, tinnitus is the perception of illusory sound that has no legitimate external source and normally arises from a small number of underlying neuropathologies. There are broadly two categories of tinnitus - Somatic Tinnitus and Hearing Loss Related Tinnitus.

MuteButton is indicated for the treatment of permanent intractable subjective tinnitus. The study is intended to show the efficacy of MuteButton treatment in alleviating tinnitus. The objective of the study will be to determine the impact of acoustic and tactile multi-modal neuromodulation on symptoms of permanent intractable tinnitus as measured by objective and subjective measures including Minimum Masking Level (MML), Tinnitus Loudness Masking (Tinnitus Loudness Masking), Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).",Tinnitus,Device,MuteButton sensory stimulation device

NCT01175993,2011-08-24,2014-02-04,Phase 1/Phase 2,Effects of Rapid-Resisted Exercise on Ambulatory Adults With Traumatic Brain Injury,"Background:

Traumatic brain injury may have a range of effects, from severe and permanent disability to more subtle functional and cognitive deficits that often go undetected during initial treatment. To improve treatments and therapies and to provide a uniform quality of care, more research is needed into different treatments for traumatic brain injury.
Exercise has been shown to improve movement and balance in people with strokes, cerebral palsy, and other conditions that affect the brain, and can improve symptoms of memory problems or depression. Bright light therapy has also been shown to improve mood in people with depression. Researchers are interested in studying problems with movement, balance, thinking, and mood in people with traumatic brain injury. By comparing the effects of exercise and bright light exposure on brain function, new treatments may be developed for acute traumatic brain injury.

Objectives:

- To compare the effects of exercise and bright light therapy on the brain function of individuals with traumatic brain injury.

Eligibility:

- Individuals between 18 and 44 years of age who either have been diagnosed with traumatic brain injury or are healthy volunteers.

Design:

Individuals with traumatic brain injury will have four outpatient evaluation visits at the clinical center, a 3-month home exercise program, and a 3-month bright light exposure program at home. Healthy volunteers will have one evaluation visit at the clinical center.
At the first study visit, all participants will have a full physical examination and medical history. Individuals with traumatic brain injury will also have an eye exam to determine if it is safe for them to receive light therapy.
All participants will have the following initial tests:
Tests of walking and movement, including monitoring by a physical therapist; tests to record joint movement and evaluate muscle function; tests that combine movement, thinking, and speaking; and balance and reaction time tests.
Magnetic resonance imaging scans
Tests of thinking and mood, including questionnaires, computerized tests, and simple action tests.
Participants with traumatic brain injury will have separate 3-month sessions of exercise and bright light therapy, with additional evaluation visits between each 3-month session and at the end of the study. Between the 3-month sessions, participants will have 1 month with no intervention.
Exercise sessions will involve regular workouts on an elliptical machine for 30 minutes for 5 days a week, and bright light therapy sessions will involve sitting in front of a light box for 30 minutes for 5 days a week. Participants will keep a journal to monitor the effects of the therapy.",Adult,Other,Elliptical exercise

Most people who get COVID-19 seem to recover with no long-term effects. However, some people who recover from acute COVID-19 infections report lingering symptoms. This is called long COVID. Many people with long COVID report symptoms related to the nervous system; these can include problems with fatigue, speech, and memory.

Objective:

To test motor memory in people with long COVID, compared to healthy volunteers.

Eligibility:

People aged 18 to 90 years who are also enrolled in study protocol 000089. Healthy adults are also needed.

Design:

Participants will be screened by telephone. They will confirm they are able to type without discomfort using their nondominant hand. They will confirm they have access to a computer connected to the internet.

All study tasks will be done online. Participants will complete 2 tasks in 2 days.

Participants will be sent a link to a website. The website will give them instructions. They will place the fingers of their nondominant hand over 4 numbers on the keyboard and type a sequence (eg, 4-1-3-2-4). They will type this sequence as often as they can in 10 seconds. Then they will rest for 10 seconds before repeating the task. They will repeat this pattern for 15 minutes.

After they finish the typing task, participants will take a 10-minute questionnaire. They will answer questions about their experiences with COVID-19 and memory issues; they will say which hand they use for tasks such as brushing their teeth or throwing a ball.

Besides that, the older adult began to use more frequently health services and had more hospitalizations by preventable conditionals with adequate care.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of educational interventions of care at home provide by nurses to family caregivers of older adult with stroke after hospital discharge, compared with usual care guidelines or no guidance, in one month follow up. The family caregivers of older adults post stroke with the first functional sequel from the Clinical Hospital of Porto Alegre (HCPA) will participate in the study.

The intervention will involve the systematic monitoring of nurses through home visits (HVs) during one month. Thus, will instrumentalize the family caregiver to care of older adult with stoke according the protocol developed in a research group and the needs of care of them.

During surgery, the study will involve stimulating the vagus nerve via the standard implanted clinical VNS electrodes over a range of stimulation parameters while recording the activity of the vagus nerve (electroneurogram (ENG)), electromyogram (EMG) response of neck/throat muscles, and the heart rate (electrocardiogram (EKG)). Stimulation parameters will be within the ranges used for clinical therapy and below limits established for non-damaging electrical stimulation.",Epilepsy,Other,electrical stimulation of vagus nerve

NCT02068391,2015-06-01,2018-09-12,Not Applicable,Achieving Brain Benefits in Covert Stroke Through Aerobic Exercise,"Silent ischemic, also known as ""covert stroke vascular disease"" (CSVD), contributes to neurological deficits that are caused by damage to small blood vessels in the brain. CSVD occurs six to ten times more often that an acute stroke. It is misleading to think, however, that CSVD is an inevitable part of ""getting old"" because people with CSVD are at high risk of developing an acute stroke or dementia. In fact, people with more CSVD lesion volume are more likely to develop day to day problems in planning, decision-making and speed of thinking. Unfortunately, there are no proven therapies designed to address CSVD. We propose to test whether aerobic exercise is an intervention that can combat CSVD because the disease is fundamentally a blood flow problem that may be improved by aerobic exercise. We will recruit CSVD adults with moderate to severe lesion burden and use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to study the brain in terms of structure, perfusion and function. Participants will be randomly assigned to either our established aerobic exercise program or a control stretching program. Both groups will take part in lab exercise sessions, which are designed to monitor progress and assess adherence to the program. The duration and intensity of their exercise will increase as participants progress. We will use activity log books, phone calls and extra ""booster"" exercise sessions, as needed, to maximize retention and adherence. We aim to show that aerobic exercise increases cerebral blood flow (CBF) in frontal-subcortical grey matter, supports regional tissue growth, and improves cognitive function in CSVD adults with substantial risk of acute stroke and dementia. A positive outcome of this research will provide strong support for additional clinical trials aimed at sustaining cognition and maintaining independent living.",Cerebral Small Vessel Diseases,Behavioral,Stretching Program

NCT03526991,2021-08-01,2024-06-30,Not Applicable,Exploring the Effects of Spinal Cord Stimulation in Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson Disease (PD) patients experience a variety of motor issues such as walking difficulties, loss of balance, and freezing while walking, which impacts their quality of life. Some symptoms, like freezing of gait (FOG), do not respond to medications typically used to treat PD. Current surgical procedures used to alleviate PD symptoms also do not always improve FOG. Since many traditional therapies have failed for the treatment of FOG, researchers have proposed the use of newer treatments. Recent research in animal models and clinical human data using SCS has produced promising results, specifically showing improvement in FOG with the use of SCS in patients with PD.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) for the management of freezing of gait (FOG) that does not respond to conventional treatments in subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD). The investigators hypothesize that SCS significantly decreases FOG episodes in patients with PD.

Assess the safety, tolerability and preliminary evidence of effectiveness of upper thoracic spinal cord stimulation for freezing of gait in Parkinson's (PD) patients.

The present study aims to identify the mechanisms underlying the deficit in facial emotion recognition reported both in schizophrenia and the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, and thus, reveal a distinction between the two disorders. Indeed, despite the clinical overlap between the two syndromes, some of the symptoms appear to be specific to only one of them. In particular, the disturbance of visual functions is specifically observed in the 22q11.2DS. Hence, the difficulties in facial emotion recognition in schizophrenia and in the 22q11.DS are likely accounted by different cognitive impairments. Investigating which mechanisms are disturbed would allow a specialized support for patients.

Our main hypothesis is that the deficit in facial emotion recognition is more related to visual impairments in the 22q11.2DS than in schizophrenia. This hypothesis will be tested in two groups of patients (22q11.2DS and schizophrenic patients) and a control group (healthy subjects) using an experimental paradigm based on electroencephalography (EEG).

A second aim of this study is to determine whether the severity of the two disorders' symptoms is correlated with the cerebral response to facial expressions.

NCT01918501,2013-08-31,2015-07-31,Not Applicable,Testing Mitochondria Activity and Blood Lipid Content of Multiple Sclerosis Patients,"Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex and multifactorial neurological disease characterized by infiltration of immune cells and progressive damage to myelin and axons. Remyelination, the generation of new myelin in the adult nervous system, is an endogenous repair mechanism that restores function of axons. Neurons require considerable energy for their activities, including synaptic neurotransmission, and hence have significant numbers of mitochondria. Unlike other cell types that are able to utilize glycolysis as an alternative energy source, glycolysis in fully differentiated neurons is basically suppressed to maintain their antioxidant status. This property makes neurons highly vulnerable to ATP deficiency, and may be a factor in the susceptibility of neurons to cell death. Mitochondria provide cellular energy by converting oxygen and nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP); and reflect local metabolic needs and via oxidative phosphorylation. Nervous tissues contain about 70% lipids of their dry weight, and around 40% of these lipids are polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs).

Goal: Understanding the relationship between blood composition, mitochondria role and clinical status.

Here, we will examine expression levels of different fatty acids in the blood and monitor mitochondrial transmembrane potential as marker for the mitochondria general function.

Hypothesis: Remyelination efficiency in MS is likely mediated by many factors, besides reducing inflammation. Remyelination may not be achieved correctly /sufficient in MS patients due to nutrition low content causing mitochondrial dysfunction and/or due to fatty acid molecules deficit unable to create a new myelin layer.",Multiple Sclerosis,Procedure,Blood testing

Intermittent theta burst stimulation (TBS), a newer form of rTMS, delivers 600 pulses in just 3 min, versus 37.5 min for conventional rTMS, but it has been shown to produce similar effects in patient with treatment-resistant depression.

To observe the effect and safety of iTBS on patients with MS and depression, we design a double-blind, randomized controlled study. Results of this research will inform on the efficiency of the TMS for the treatment of depression in MS patients, which will reduce the risk of disability and improve the quality of life.","Depression, Anxiety",Device,sham intermittent theta burst stimulation using a MagPro X100
NCT04936620,2021-10-08,2026-10-08,Not Applicable,Duroplasty for Injured Cervical Spinal Cord With Uncontrolled Swelling,"QUESTION. Does duroplasty improve outcome after spinal cord injury?

WHAT DO WE STUDY? We will investigate whether performing a surgical procedure called duroplasty improves outcomes after spinal cord injury.

WHY SPINAL CORD INJURY? Spinal cord injury is a devastating condition that causes permanent disability such as paralysis, numbness and loss of bladder and bowel control. Currently, there are no treatments shown to improve outcome after spinal cord injury.

WHAT IS DUROPLASTY? Duroplasty is an operation that involves opening the tough membrane around the cord, called the dura, and stitching a patch of artificial dura to expand the space around the swollen cord.

WHY IS DUROPLASTY BEING STUDIED? Based on our preliminary evidence, we think that the dura causes cord pressure after injury. We have shown in a small study of patients that performing this operation safely and effectively reduces pressure on the injured cord.

WHO IS ELIGIBLE? Adult patients with severe spinal cord injuries in the neck who will have surgery within 72 hours.

WHAT TREATMENT? Those who agree to take part will be allocated by chance (like tossing a coin) to standard treatment or standard treatment plus duroplasty. Some patients will also be asked to take part in a smaller study that involves placing probes at the injury site.

WHERE? We will recruit patients from U.K. Major Trauma Centres. Most assessments will be done in U.K. Spinal Injury Centres. Later on, we may recruit from overseas.

HOW LONG? We aim to recruit 222 - 260 patients over 4 years. Patients will be followed up for a year.

WHAT DO WE ASSESS? Patients will be assessed (using questionnaires and by examination) how well they can use their hands, walk, control their bladder and bowel and their quality of life. Some of these assessments will be repeated at 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery.

WHAT IS THE OPTIONAL MECHANISTIC STUDY? DISCUS includes an optional study for at least 50 patients who will take part in the randomised controlled trial. The aim of the mechanistic study is to determine how duroplasty improves outcome, i.e. whether duroplasty reduces cord compression, improves blood flow to the injured cord perfusion, improves cord metabolism and reduces cord inflammation.

WHAT IS THE OPTIONAL INFORMATION STUDY? For the first two years, a study called QuinteT Recruitment Intervention (QRI) is designed to optimise patient recruitment and informed consent in the trauma setting.",Spinal Cord Injuries,Procedure,Duroplasty

NCT02466165,2015-02-28,2015-12-31,Not Applicable,Multiple Sclerosis: Associated Cardiometabolic Risks and Impact of Exercise Therapy,"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most common chronic inflammatory neurological disorder in young adults. Due to heterogeneous symptoms, MS patients are often more inactive than healthy controls, resulting in an inactivity related physiological profile. In healthy people, physical inactivity can contribute to the development of an increased cardiometabolic risk state including the combined presence of cardiovascular risk factors (increased cholesterol, elevated blood pressure, body fat, glucose intolerance/insulin resistance, inflammation and reduced heart function/autonomic control). In other populations, these secondary health complications can be, in part, reduced by physical exercise, which is often used as the primary treatment strategy. Since the impact of exercise on cardiovascular risk factors in MS is unknown the present project first aims to explore this in a pilot trial and a controlled research setting (during 12 weeks). A better understanding of the above described risk factors and underlying physiological mechanisms will reduce the incidence of preventable comorbidities in MS and will further improve the multidisciplinary treatment of MS patients and MS rehabilitation in particular. Interestingly, the investigators already reported an elevated prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance in MS, but it is not clear whether the cardiometabolic state in MS is also impaired.

Stroke survivors generally require lifelong support from family caregivers. The abrupt onset of stroke and associated physical and cognitive impairments result in a series of complex and demanding interactions between family caregivers and stroke survivors. More than 40% of stroke caregivers develop depressive symptoms over time. The depression of family caregivers negatively impacts their physical health and caregiving role and directly affects the mental health and recovery of stroke survivors. Thus, effective strategies for stressful caregiving situations are urgently needed.

As postulated in the relational/problem solving model of stress, problem-solving coping is a cognitive behavioral process that can enhance caregivers' well-being by changing caregiving situations and/or changing their negative emotional stress responses to stressful situations into positive responses. In view of the influence of negative emotions on the cognitive process of an individual, integrating perspective taking as a cognitive reappraisal strategy into the training of problem-solving coping skills may potentially improve the psychosocial well-being of family caregivers.

This mixed method study aims (1) to examine the effects of a emotion-centered problem-solving intervention on the depressive symptoms, problem-solving coping, emotion regulation, caregiving competence, and health-related quality of life of stroke caregivers and on the physical functioning of stroke survivors; (2) to explore the mediating effect of emotion regulation and problem solving coping on caregivers' depressive symptoms, caregiving competence, and health-related quality of life and on stroke survivors' physical functioning; and (3) to understand how intervention influences depressive symptoms from a family caregiver's perspective. A total of 178 family caregivers will be recruited from various non-government organizations and nurse clinics for stroke patients of the Hospital Authority. Participants will be randomly allocated to the intervention group (IG) and control group (CG). Caregivers in the IG will receive an emotion-centered problem-solving intervention adopting a ""shared problem, shared action plan"" approach, whereas the caregivers in the CG will receive stroke-related education. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, 12 and 36 weeks after study entry.

This study makes the first attempt to develop an emotion-centered problem-solving intervention and examine its effectiveness in the context of stroke caregiving.

NCT00573612,2007-12-31,2011-12-31,Not Applicable,Exercise-based Motivational Interviewing for Fibromyalgia,"Fibromyalgia (FMS), defined as the presence of both chronic widespread pain and the finding of 11/18 tender points on examination, affects 2% of the general population. Drug therapy for FMS is largely symptomatic as there is not yet a complete understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease. In the past 17 years, supervised aerobic exercise has emerged as an important treatment modality to improve pain, aerobic capacity, function, and well-being. Individuals who are able to adhere to exercise almost always maintain the symptomatic benefits of exercise. Unfortunately, the rate of exercise adherence six months after the completion of a well-structured supervised exercise program is disappointingly low. Furthermore, although the efficacy of supervised aerobic exercise in the research setting is well documented, the applicability of such intervention in the clinic setting is doubtful. Therefore, we propose to conduct the Research to Encourage Exercise for Fibromyalgia (REEF), a randomized attention-controlled trial whose primary aim is to evaluate the efficacy of telephone-delivered motivational interviewing (MI) to encourage exercise, in improving exercise adherence and self-report physical function (co-primary outcome measures) for FMS patients. REEF will enroll 200 FMS patients, randomizing them to either the MI group or the attention-control (AC) group. Participants from each group will receive a total of 6 telephone calls within a 12-week period. Prior to the phone calls, participants from both groups will receive an individualized exercise prescription and 2 supervised exercise training sessions to get them started on an exercise program. All subjects will undergo comprehensive outcome assessment at baseline, week 12, week 24, and week 36. The secondary aim of this proposal is to determine the mediators between MI and improvement in self-report physical function. The proposed research is significant because our focus is the promotion of adherence to an exercise program, of adequate intensity, in order to maximize functioning and well-being for patients with FMS. The use of a predominantly home-based exercise program and telephone-delivered MI by a trained licensed practice nurse (LPN) could potentially make the proposed intervention more accessible to the greater majority of FMS patients. Furthermore, if proven efficacious, MI could readily be applied to other chronically painful conditions (e.g. chronic back pain).",Fibromyalgia,Behavioral,Attention Control Counseling

The AMEND Sub-study,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), central sleep apnea (CSA) and heart failure (HF) are states of metabolic demand and sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activation. In patients with sleep apnea and HF, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) initially may reduce left ventricular (LV)stroke volume (SV) but subsequently improves and LV function. This may relate to an early beneficial effect on myocardial energetics through early reduction in metabolic demand that subsequently leads to improved efficiency of LV contraction. However, it is not clear whether long-term adaptive servo-ventilation (ASV) favorably affects cardiac energetics. Any such benefit may also relate to reduced sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activation. However its effect on myocardial SNS function is also not well studied.

In a pilot study we demonstrated early (6 week) beneficial effects of CPAP in patients with OSA and HF. The current proposal (AMEND) is a unique substudy of the recently funded ADVENT-HF trial (Adaptive Servo Ventilation for Therapy of Sleep Apnea in HeartFailure) (NCT01128816; CIHR; D. Bradley, PI).

We propose to evaluate the long-term (6 month) effects of ASV on daytime 1) oxidative metabolism; 2) the work metabolic index (WMI) as an estimate of mechanical efficiency; 3) myocardial sympathetic nerve (SN) pre-synaptic function; and 4) heart rate (HR) variability in patients with HF and coexisting OSA or CSA.

NCT05406921,2022-07-18,2023-07-17,Not Applicable,Implementation of MIND at Home Program in Primary Care for People Living With Dementia: A Pilot Study,"The number of people living with dementia (PLWD) is growing. PLWD are often cared for at home by an informal caregiver, but this care is often not sufficient, resulting in costly hospitalizations and other unnecessary and avoidable use of health services. In addition, many PLWD are transferred to costly long-term care facilities despite their preference to live at home. One way to improve care for PLWD is to work with their primary care doctors to provide better quality of care at lower costs for their patients. To accomplish this, we propose to collaboratively implement the MIND at Home Dementia Care Coordination Program into primary care clinics. The program expands the skills of existing primary care staff to the level of Memory Care Coordinators (MCCs), who will work with a larger primary care team on combining the benefits of clinic-based services with home-based services that support PLWD, their families, and care partners.

Two health care organizations will enroll 150 people in the MIND at Home program for 3 months at a time. The program includes one home visit per month, a comprehensive needs assessment (which assesses medical, nonmedical, social, and environmental issues), the subsequent development and implementation of an individualized care plan, and unlimited contact with the MCC for the PLWD, their family, and care partner. The primary care team, including the MCC, will also have access to weekly virtual sessions focused on dementia and including short lectures and the discussion of specific case examples.

Rates of monthly hospitalizations among participants and emergency room (ER) visits and number of medications the PLWD takes every month will be collected from the health care organization. The hypothesis is that the rate of hospitalizations and ER visits will decrease, and the number of medications will also decrease. We hope to positively impact the quality and costs of care associated with caring for PLWD.

This pilot seeks to test the feasibility of implementing the MIND at Home program into primary care in a racially, ethnically, and geographically diverse population of PLWD to prepare for a larger study that will determine this program's effectiveness and spread it broadly into primary care clinics across the country.

From the perspectives of health systems and overall society, MIND at Home will reduce costs, improve primary care team satisfaction, and preserve the dignity and independence of PLWD by enabling them to age at home.",Dementia,Behavioral,MIND at Home

Standard therapy for symptomatic CSH is surgical drainage. However, the recurrence rate after surgery is high (10 to 20% in the most of series, although it has been reported from 2 to 37%). Middle meningeal artery embolization (MMAE) is a promising minimally invasive procedure that has recently been proposed as an alternative or adjunctive treatment to surgery. The investigators hypothesize that early post operative endovascular treatment can reduce the recurrence rate in high-risk patients, improving neurological outcomes by reducing the need for reinterventions, hospitalizations, and post-operative complications. The aim of the investigators is to analyze the efficacy of and safety of early post-surgical embolization of MMA in reducing the risk of CSH recurrence.",Chronic Subdural Hematoma,Procedure,"Post surgical embolization of middle meningeal artery with liquid embolic agents (ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymers as Onix, Squid, Phil or Libro)"

In such cases, surgery is the treatment of choice. Complete resection of affected brain tissue is associated with highest probability of seizure freedom. However, epileptogenic brain tissue is visually identical to normal brain tissue, complicating complete resection. Modern investigative methods are of limited use.

An important subjective assessment during surgery is that affected brain tissue feels stiffer, however there is presently no way to determine this without committing to resecting the affected area. It is hypothesized that intra-operative use of a tonometer (Diaton) will identify abnormal brain tissue stiffness in affected brain relative to normal brain. This will help identify stiffer brain regions without having to resect them.

The objective is to determine if intra-operative use of a tonometer to measure brain tissue stiffness will offer additional precision in identifying epileptogenic lesions.

In participants with refractory epilepsy, various locations on the cerebral cortex will be identified using standard pre-operative investigations like magnetic resonance imagin (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET). These are areas of presumed normal and abnormal brain where the tonometer will be used during surgery to measure brain tissue stiffness. Brain tissue stiffness measurements will then be compared with results of routine pre-operative and intra-operative tests. Such comparisons will help determine if and to what extent intra-operative brain tissue stiffness measurements correlate with other tests and help identify epileptogenic brain tissue.

24 participants have already undergone intra-operative brain tonometry. Results in these participants are encouraging: abnormally high brain tissue stiffness measurements have consistently been identified and significantly associated with abnormal brain tissue.

NCT04344626,2018-07-16,2023-03-31,Not Applicable,Use of a Tonometer to Identify Focal Cortical Dysplasia and Tuberous Sclerosis Complex During Pediatric Epilepsy Surgery,"Refractory epilepsy, meaning epilepsy that no longer responds to medication, is a common neurosurgical indication in children. In such cases, surgery is the treatment of choice. Complete resection of affected brain tissue is associated with highest probability of seizure freedom. However, epileptogenic brain tissue is visually identical to normal brain tissue, complicating complete resection. Modern investigative methods are of limited use.

An important subjective assessment during surgery is that affected brain tissue feels stiffer, however there is presently no way to determine this without committing to resecting the affected area. It is hypothesized that intra-operative use of a tonometer (Diaton) will identify abnormal brain tissue stiffness in affected brain relative to normal brain. This will help identify stiffer brain regions without having to resect them.

The objective is to determine if intra-operative use of a tonometer to measure brain tissue stiffness will offer additional precision in identifying epileptogenic lesions.

In participants with refractory epilepsy, various locations on the cerebral cortex will be identified using standard pre-operative investigations like magnetic resonance imagin (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET). These are areas of presumed normal and abnormal brain where the tonometer will be used during surgery to measure brain tissue stiffness. Brain tissue stiffness measurements will then be compared with results of routine pre-operative and intra-operative tests.

NCT01888640,2013-09-30,2018-04-02,Not Applicable,Fibromyalgia Activity Study With Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation,"Pain associated with fibromyalgia interferes with daily function, work, and social activities resulting in a decreased quality of life. People with fibromyalgia also have a significant amount of fatigue and a fear of movement. People with fibromyalgia show enhanced excitability of pain neurons in the central nervous system and reduced pain inhibition. Therefore, one of the main treatments for patients with fibromyalgia must focus on pain relief to allow the person to function more independently both at home and at work. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation is used by health professionals to deliver electrical stimulation through the skin for pain control. Basic science studies, from the PI's laboratory show that TENS activates descending pain inhibitory pathways to inhibit excitability of pain neurons. Thus the ideal patient population for the treatment of TENS would be one in which there is enhanced central excitability and reduced inhibition; fibromyalgia is such a condition.

Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that application of Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) to patients with fibromyalgia will reduce resting and movement-related pain and reduce central excitability by restoring diffuse noxious inhibitory controls (DNIC), and that this decrease in pain and/or central excitability will reduce fatigue and fear of movement, thereby improving function and quality of life",Fibromyalgia,Device,TENS

Older adults are often excluded from research due to strict inclusion criteria. It is critical for a sustainable health service system that these patients are empowered and reach their maximum level of independence. The Perceive, Recall, Plan and Perform System (PRPP) of Intervention can be applied by Occupational Therapists (OT) for clients with cognitive challenges to enhance mastery of needed or desired everyday tasks. There is no current evidence for the effectiveness of this intervention for this population.

Purpose: A clinical trial to investigate the effectiveness of the PRPP intervention for older persons with cognitive impairments after brain injury in the context of community-based rehabilitation.

Method: In PRPP intervention the OT uses systematically instructions in task training to support a client to use cognitive strategies efficiently. The everyday tasks used for training should be valued by the participant and useful in their rehabilitation. The tasks could include different parts of morning routines, simple or complex meal planning or preparation, use of cell phone, leisure activities, or other household and community activities. At best the skills are generalized throughout all everyday activities, and the OTs' role as a cognitive mediator fades as participants internalize the strategies. The participants receive PRPP intervention 3 times a week for 3 weeks, every session last for 45-60 minutes.

The participants' task mastery and cognitive strategy use will be measured at least 5 times in each phase: baseline, intervention, after the intervention, and 4 weeks after the discharge from rehabilitation. The measurement scores at baseline act controls and are therefore compared with the other phases for the same participant. The same procedure will be repeated for the other participants, but then with a staggered intervention phase. A staggered intervention phase acts as a control between participants and allows to see if changes occur only when the intervention is introduced.

Implications for practice: The investigators assume that this systematic intervention will improve everyday task performance, and will in turn contribute to empowerment and independence of older adults with cognitive challenges after brain injuries.",Brain Injuries,Behavioral,"The Perceive, Recall, Plan and Perform System of Intervention"

Thirty three with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients (diagnosis of probable AD according to the criteria of the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke Alzheimer Disease and Related Disorders Association [NINCDS-ADRDA] were included in this study) were randomly classified into one of three groups (eleven for each group). The first group received anodal tDCS over left DLPFC and 2rd group received cathodal tDCS on the left DLPFC and the 3rd group received sham tDCS stimulation, daily for 10 consecutive days (5 days/week for 2 weeks). Minimental State Examination (MMSE), psychometric assessment for cognitive functions (MMSE, Wechsler memory scale, Wechsler adult Intelligent scale) were assessed before, after 10th sessions, and then after 1 and 2 month.

NCT00566709,2009-06-30,2009-12-31,Phase 2,"Phase II Study of Usefulness of Near Infrared Spectroscopy to Optimize Red Blood Cells Transfusion in Neuro Critical Ill Patients With Severe Traumatic Brain Injury, Subarachnoid Hemorrhage or Intracerebral Hemorrhage.","Neurocritical ill patients are frequently transfused. Red blood cell transfusion (RBCT) in these patients has been associated with deleterious effects, including higher rates of nosocomial infections, multi-organ failure, and mortality. Therefore, it seems crucial to avoid any unnecessary RBCT.

Most critically ill patients tolerate hemoglobin levels near 7 g/dL without an increase in morbidity or mortality rates. In this regard, a recent sub-analysis of TRICC trial has showed that TBI patients may tolerate hemoglobin levels as low as 7 g/dL, but other studies including neurocritical patients suggested that severe anemia may worsen clinical outcome. Therefore, optimal hemoglobin levels in neurocritical care patients remain largely unknown. Some textbooks and guidelines recommend to transfuse these patients to reach hemoglobin levels near to 10 g/dL, despite the lack of a solid scientific background supporting this target.

Even though it has not been demonstrated, hemoglobin-based RBCT prescription could result in over- or under-transfusion in neurocritical patients. Alternatively, it has been suggested that more physiological transfusion triggers, using direct signals coming from the brain, will progressively replace arbitrary hemoglobin-based transfusion triggers in the neurocritical patients [65]. At the neurocritical units, patients are often monitored by using non-invasive methods, such as near infrared spectroscopy which indirectly measures regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2). Changes in rSO2 values have been shown to directly correlate with changes in erythrocyte mass, thus increasing with RBCT and decreasing with blood losses. Moreover, rSO2 values also show a good correlation with clinical outcome and other variables which are often monitored in TBI patients.

The purpose of this study is to ascertain as to whether rSO2 levels are more efficacious than conventional hemoglobin levels in guiding RBCT in patients admitted to a neurocritical care unit.",Traumatic Brain Injury,Procedure,Red blood cells transfusion

NCT05345886,2022-05-01,2025-01-01,Not Applicable,The Benefit of Hippotherapy in the Therapeutic Management of Stroke Patients in Sequel Phase,"This study aims to explore the interest of hippotherapy in the management of patients with stroke in the sequelae phase by evaluating the psychological and physical well-being. It is a controlled and randomized prospective longitudinal study.

Hippotherapy is a rehabilitation method entrusted to a paramedical or medical profession that uses the horse in its treatment program in addition to conventional medical care.

Hippotherapy has benefits at the psychomotor and motor level. The method is based on the use of the horse's characteristic movements when walking to provide sensory information and to induce motor adjustment responses mainly at the level of the pelvis and the trunk of the rider in order to work on balance, postural control, muscle tone and joint mobility of the patient sitting on his back. In particular for people with paresis or plegia sequelae, it contributes to rehabilitation programs. In addition, by inducing a helical movement of the pelvis, the horse's walk reproduces in the the disabled rider a pattern of trunk reactions very similar to that of the normal human walking pattern. This pattern can be integrated as a normal sensorimotor reaction and help the patient to improve his sitting balance and his coordination.

Hippotherapy is also interesting because getting out of the traditional rehabilitation framework and being in contact with an imposing animal has positive repercussions on the psyche and therefore on functional recovery.

All patients will undergo an assessment that will focus on their physical and psychological well-being at the beginning and end of the study as well as during a follow-up at 2 weeks, one month and 3 months.

Patients assigned to the experimental group (EG) will receive, in addition to their physical therapy, a weekly hippotherapy session of 30 minutes. The follow-up will take place during 3 months for a total of 12 sessions. The EG will also be monitored in the short term (before and after each session) for well-being and fatigue.

Quality of life will be explored using the SF-36 questionnaire and the SS-QOL scale. Self-esteem will be measured using the Rosenberg scale. Patients' physical abilities will be assessed with functional tests, standing balance measurements on a strength platform and the ABC-S self-evaluation scale.",Stroke,Behavioral,Hippotherapy

NCT04011787,2022-07-01,2023-09-30,Not Applicable,The Relative Effectiveness of BOLUS Versus Continuous Nasogastric Feeding After Stroke: a Proof of Principal Study,"Patients with severe strokes are often unable to be take oral diet food and fluids safely because they cannot swallow effectively. Therefore, patients need to be fed via a tube placed through the nose into the stomach (nasogastric tube). Tube feeding can be given by the intermittent (bolus) method, whereby the feed is given over a short time (15 to 30 minutes), or by the continuous feeding method, where the feed is given continuously over 10-16 hours. Nasogastric feeding can be complicated by vomiting or reflux of the feed into the oesophagus causing aspiration of gastric contents into the lung and pneumonia. Nasogastric feeds can be given continuously or as bolus feeds. Healthy people eating normally take their diet in discrete meals. The human digestive system is adapted to intermittent food intake and is likely to work best if food is provided in this pattern, but the larger volume of the feed by this method may cause vomiting and aspiration. It is unclear which method is better for allowing normal digestive processes and reducing pneumonia due to aspirated feeds. There are no trials comparing these two feeding methods in patients with acute stroke. The aim of this small study is to determine if a trial comparing the two treatment approaches is feasible in patients with acute stroke, and to collect information on the effects on feed tolerance and digestion.

In this study we will compare the effect of the bolus and intermittent nasogastric tube feeding on digestion and feed tolerance in 20 patients who need nasogastric feeding within 36 hours of a stroke. Patients will be randomly allocated to be given the feeds either by the bolus or by the continuous method for 7 days. During this time they will be examined every day. The study will examine how effectively food is digested by measuring the amount of feed given and the metabolic responses of the body by looking at changes in the level of blood sugar and digestive hormones. The investigators will also monitor complications such as vomiting, diarrhoea, and pneumonia. Patients will be randomly allocated to be given the feeds either by the bolus or by the continuous method for 7 days.

NCT03435731,2018-03-08,2018-12-31,Not Applicable,Dual Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) Therapy (MAS With PAP),"Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is considered the gold standard therapy for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). However, CPAP users sometimes experience pressure-related discomfort. It is thought that lower CPAP pressure may increase comfort and lead to greater treatment adherence.

Mandibular advancement splint (MAS) therapy has been shown to be the preferred OSA treatment option among patients. However, MAS therapy is only partially effective in some OSA patients, especially in severe cases.

It is thought that a combination of MAS and PAP therapy may benefit patients in which MAS alone is only partially effective. Using MAS and PAP at the same time is called ""Dual Therapy"". Dual Therapy may allow a lower CPAP pressure to be applied, which may increase patient comfort and therefore increase treatment adherence and overall effectiveness.

This study will evaluate the effectiveness of 1 month of Dual Therapy in 30 OSA patients.",Obstructive Sleep Apnea,Combination Product,Dual Therapy

- Electrical impedance myography (EIM) is a new technique being studied to see if it is helpful in evaluating muscle disorders and nerve disorders. EIM looks at how a mild, painless electrical current travels through muscles. Researchers want to gain experience in using the EIM device. They will collect information on the results of using it on people with and without nerve and muscle diseases, and compare that with information from other standard tests. First, they will test the device on healthy people. Then they will test people with a variety of neuromuscular diseases. Because the test is noninvasive and not painful, researchers will test both children and adults.

Exoskeletal technology has the potential to help people with impaired leg function to regain ambulation and thus improve their independence. This technology is not completely new, but due to their high access price (~120k€/unit), high size and weight (~25 kg), and need for trained physiotherapist supervision, commercially available exoskeletons are only found in large hospitals and only in very few cases get into patients' homes.

The company ABLE Human Motion S.L. (Barcelona, Spain) has developed a novel exoskeleton to overcome these disadvantages, which is more compact, lighter and easier to use.

The primary objective of the study is to investigate the impact of recent design changes performed on the device on the safety, feasibility and usability of the ABLE exoskeleton device in people with spinal cord injury during a five to six weeks gait training programme in a clinical setting.

As a result, people with SCI have impaired thermoregulatory system and the consequence of this thermoregulatory dysfunction, is that they cannot respond to the environmental changes. All the above lead to dysregulation in vasomotor tone, skeletal muscle shivering and sweating dysfunction. It is well known that skin plays an important role in regulating body temperature and regulates interactions between the environment and human body. A previous study in people with incomplete SCI showed that there are no differences in core temperature between patients with different level of mobility and sensation and different level of lesion, but there are significant differences in skin temperature. As mentioned above people with SCI have an impaired thermoregulatory capacity due to sudomotor and vasomotor dysfunction and that leads to greater thermal strain during rest and exercise when they expose to hot conditions. A previous study that performed exercise in people with SCI, highlights the fact that because of the impaired evaporative heat loss during exercise in hot conditions, they are in great risk. Because of this risk they propose different cooling strategies that promote evaporation such as fans and water spraying.

A previous study in people with incomplete SCI showed that there are no differences in core temperature between patients with different level of mobility and sensation and different level of lesion, but there are significant differences in skin temperature. As mentioned above people with SCI have an impaired thermoregulatory capacity due to sudomotor and vasomotor dysfunction and that leads to greater thermal strain during rest and exercise when they expose to hot conditions. A previous study that performed exercise in people with SCI, highlights the fact that because of the impaired evaporative heat loss during exercise in hot conditions, they are in great risk. Because of this risk they propose different cooling strategies that promote evaporation such as fans and water spraying. It is therefore important to observe the thermoregulatory function (vasomotion and sudomotor) in people with SCI when they are exposed to different environments (cold, neutral and warm).",Paraplegia,Behavioral,Thermoneutral environment healthy male participants

Upwards of 77% of family caregivers experience poor outcomes, such as adverse life changes, poor health related quality of life, and increased depressive symptoms. Caregivers frequently report minimal support or training to prepare them for their new role. Periods of care transitions, such as ICU discharge, are most difficult. The majority (93%) of previously developed caregiver and caregiver/survivor dyad interventions after msTBI focus on providing information or practical skills to either survivors, or to long-term caregivers (>6 months post injury), rather than education, support, and skill-building that the new caregiver may use proactively that will benefit the dyad acutely after injury. The Aims of this proposal are to: (1) Determine feasibility, satisfaction, and data trends of CG-Well; and (2) Understand how baseline psychosocial risk factors affect response to CG-Well compared to an Information, Support, and Referral control group. To accomplish this, I will first enroll 6-10 caregivers and tailor CG-well until each finds the intervention acceptable, appropriate, and feasible. I will then enroll 100 (50/group) dyads and determine satisfaction ratings, recruitment, retention, and treatment fidelity of CG-Well. Additionally, I will determine if caregivers report reductions in depressive symptoms and improvements in life changes as a result of improvements in task difficulty and threat appraisal in CG-Well compared to ISR at six months. Information obtained in Aims 1 and 2 will be used to plan a larger Phase III trial of CG-Well. Completing these Aims and the training plan will improve outcomes of caregivers and downstream outcomes of survivors of msTBI, and provide me with the skillset necessary to become an independent researcher who can develop and test high-impact, high-fidelity, sustainable interventions.","Trauma, Brain",Behavioral,CG-Well

These patients are complex; and the ventilator´s parameters should be set-up according to the underlying disease and particular patient's characteristics. The non-invasive ventilation therapy is mostly titrated while the patient is awake, hence Problems, such as Patient-Ventilator asynchrony, arising while sleeping on the ventilator therapy would remain undetected.

Sleep studies, such as polysomnography or polygraphy and transcutaneous carbon dioxide monitoring could be valuable tools to fine-tune the ventilator's settings. This could foster the ventilator´s effectivity and patient satisfaction, thus therapy's adherence. Nevertheless the sleep studies are expensive, time-consuming and not widely available.

The aim of this study is to learn the findings of sleep studies when they are performed on stable patients on home mechanical ventilation as part of their routine check-ups. In this context, it will be assessed whether the sleep studies' findings lead to a change (adjustment) of the ventilator´s therapy. Moreover, this study aims to investigate whether the absence of sleep studies would result in missing important events that require an adjustment of therapy. The results of this study could provide information that lead to a more standardized protocol of follow-up checks of patients on home mechanical ventilation in a cost-effective manner.",Hypoventilation Syndrome,Diagnostic Test,Sleep studies under noninvasive ventilation therapy

NCT01282307,2008-02-29,2012-07-31,Not Applicable,Meaningful Change With the Method Guided Self-Determination - a Randomised Controlled Study for Patients Diagnosed With Schizophrenia.,"Background:

Rehospitalisation and discontinued treatment are common among patients with schizophrenia and is often associated with lack of insight into the illness. Improving patients' insight has been attempted through psychoeducation and standard treatment but without any considerable change. A newly developed method, Guided Self-Determination (GSD), originally developed and proved effective in difficult diabetes care has been adjusted to patients with schizophrenia. A qualitative evaluation of GSD has shown a positive influence on patients' insight into the illness.

Aim and hypotheses: The aim of the study is to evaluate the effects of the method GSD in the care of patients with schizophrenia compared to treatment as usual. The following hypotheses will be tested:

The method GSD will improve: Cognitive and clinical insight in patients, various domains of recovery, patients' self-esteem, psychopathology and social functioning.

Material and method:

The study design is a randomised controlled trial. The participants are diagnosed with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, receiving treatment in 3 Assertive Outreach Teams and 3 Psychosis Teams in Region North. Participants complete four self-rating questionnaires, a demographic data sheet, an interview concerning psychopathology and an assessment of social functioning at baseline, and after 3, 6, and 12 month. All assessments will be conducted by the investigator, except for the assessment of social functioning, that will be measures by community nurses. Intervention with the method GSD will also be conducted by the community nurses but under supervision from the investigator. Fifty patients are randomly assigned to immediate receipt of individual training with the method GSD (intervention group) and 50 to a 12-month waiting list for individual training with the method GSD (control group).

Perspectives:

In mental health nursing practice in Denmark there is no tradition for empirical research as the basis of psychiatric nursing - unverified theories or general empirical consensus of good clinical practice are often the foundation of psychiatric nursing.

The sphenopalatine ganglion, located in the posterior part of the middle nasal turbinate, is involved in the pain associated to TN, by blocking the sphenopalatine ganglion relieves patients from the symptoms. However, methods currently in use to accomplish this are either cumbersome for the patient or invasive regarding the puncture of structures.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Tx360™, a new nasal applicator device, in the treatment of TN. A local anesthetic will be delivered on the ganglion area. We are expecting that this new device will provide at least the same pain relief as the previously described approaches.

NCT04270955,2020-03-11,2025-12-31,Not Applicable,A Single Center Randomized Control Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy of Middle Meningeal Artery Embolization in the Treatment of Chronic Subdural Hematomas,"Chronic subdural hematomas (cSDH) are one form of bleeding in the head. They are one of the most common diseases encountered by neurosurgeons across the country. The cSDH can push on the brain and produce symptoms that include seizures, weakness, loss of sensation, and confusion. Many of these cSDH produce repetitive bleeding.

Treatment has largely consisted of surgical drainage of hematoma (also known as a blood clot) through either a small hole in the skull or open surgery. However, it is common for the cSDH to reappear despite these procedures. A recent study has shown a treatment failure rate of 27% and a need for additional surgery at 19%.

A new approach to treatment of cSDH blocks the blood supply to the tissue that produces the repeated bleeding. Catheters are used to gain access to the middle meningeal artery (MMA), an artery that supplies the coverings of the brain. The artery is blocked using small particles or glue in a process called embolization. A recent pilot study of 72 patients who underwent MMA embolization showed a much lower rate of repeated bleeding. Based on these results, it is thought that this procedure holds promise in reducing the number of cSDH that require one or more operations.

The clinical picture is very variable, ultimately resulting in disability. Disease attacks manifest themselves depending on the location of the CNS damaged by inflammation, demyelination, axonal loss and gliosis. The most common manifestations include motor disorders with the development of stiffness, balance and coordination, cognition, fatigue and depression. In the long term, most patients with MS will achieve significant and irreversible incapacitation. Immunomodulatory therapy is designed to reduce disease activity, slowing progression, but only to a certain extent. A significant benefit, but little researched, is physical exercise. Tai Chi has a positive effect on various neurological diseases. In recent studies, Tai Chi has shown improvements in coordination and balance, depression, anxiety, cognition and overall quality of life in patients with MS.

It is a well-tolerated procedure that can be performed on an outpatient basis. It uses a plastic covered coil that sends a magnetic pulse through the skull into the brain and by targeting particular areas in the brain it can be used to help modulate the perception of pain.

The study intends to use this technique to treat such a disabling symptom in patients who suffer from Parkinson's Disease (PD). Initially the aim is to study this technique in ten patients who are suffering from pain and have PD. These patients would initially require an MRI scan which allows us to map the brain and target the correct brain areas for the delivery of the stimulation. The stimulation would be performed over ten sessions and the patients would be assessed by a clinician using well recognized clinical tools.

It is anticipated that there will be a meaningful improvement in pain. It is also anticipated that TMS is a safe technique to use in patients with PD. The study will be used to help plan a future study that compares TMS with sham technique to prove whether TMS could be an option in the treatment of such a disabling condition.",Parkinson Disease,Device,Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation

It has been suggested that the decline in functional capacity is associated with musculoskeletal and systemic changes than primary organ (heart and/or lung) failure. In addition, it is recognized that both diseases have several mechanisms that are responsible for musculoskeletal impairment. However, the association of reduced systemic perfusion with low oxygen content observed in the association of HF and COPD may contribute to the worsening of the components of the muscle impairment cascade. Thus, muscle strength and fatigue may not only be even more altered but may also be the main determinants of functional capacity in patients with coexistence of HF and COPD.

These children experience one or more physical and psychological symptoms simultaneously that can seriously affect their quality of life and increase use of health services. Parents may feel challenged, lacking confidence in their abilities when managing their child's symptoms. Literature suggested that increasing parental self-efficacy in managing their child's symptoms could improve the child's health.

This proposed randomized controlled trial will test the effects of a mobile App with nurse support for enhancing parental self-efficacy in symptom management for CMC in communities. A repeated-measures, two-group design will be used to evaluate the effects between intervention and wait-listed control groups by comparing the study group receiving nurse parental support in symptom management using a proactive mobile application, and the wait-listed control group receiving usual community care for 120 randomly selected parents over a three-month follow-up. Primary outcome is parental self-efficacy. Secondary outcomes include children's symptom burden and health services utilization. These factors will be measured before intervention, immediately after intervention and three-month after intervention. The effectiveness of the intervention will be evaluated by comparing the primary outcome (parental self-efficacy) at three-month after intervention across the two study groups using ANCOVA with control for the pre-test value of parental self-efficacy (primary objective).

NCT05593237,2022-04-25,2025-01-30,Not Applicable,A Pilot Trial of Longitudinal Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) for Chronic Neuropathic Pain,"Chronic neuropathic pain is defined as pain caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system. It is highly prevalent, debilitating, and challenging to treat. Current available treatments have low efficacy, high side effect burden, and are prone to misuse and dependence. Emerging evidence suggests that the transition from acute to chronic neuropathic pain is associated with reorganization of central brain circuits involved in pain processing. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a promising alternative treatment that uses focused magnetic pulses to non-invasively modulate brain activity, a strategy that can potentially circumvent the adverse effects of available treatments for pain. RTMS is FDA-approved for the treatment of major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and migraine, and has been shown to reduce pain scores when applied to the contralateral motor cortex (M1). However, available studies of rTMS for chronic neuropathic pain typically show variable and often short-lived benefits, and many aspects of optimal treatment remain unknown, including ideal rTMS stimulation parameters, duration of treatment, and relationship to the underlying pain etiology. Here the investigators propose to evaluate the efficacy of high frequency rTMS to M1, the region with most evidence of benefit in chronic neuropathic pain, and to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify alternative rTMS targets for participants that do not respond to stimulation at M1. The central aim is to evaluate the pain relieving efficacy of multi-session high-frequency M1 TMS for pain. In secondary exploratory analyses, the investigator propose to investigate patient characteristic that are predictive of responsive to M1 rTMS and identify viable alternative stimulation targets in non-responders to M1 rTMS.",Chronic Neuropathic Pain,Device,High Frequency rTMS

NCT01715948,2013-01-31,2013-10-31,Not Applicable,A Comparison Between Wireless CROS and Bone-anchored Hearing Devices for Single-Sided Deafness: A Pilot Study,"People with single-sided deafness (SSD) have significant hearing loss in one ear and normal or near normal hearing in the other ear. Those living with SSD experience several communication difficulties, particularly when listening to speech in the presence of background noise. This problem is worse in situations where the noise is on the side of the good ear and the speech is on the side of the poor ear.

The Bone-anchored hearing device (BAHD) and the Contralateral Routing of Signals (CROS) hearing aid are two intervention methods designed to improve hearing in people who have significant hearing loss in one ear only. The BAHD is a surgically implanted device which also includes an external processor; sounds from the poor ear are transmitted to the good ear through skull vibrations. The CROS does not involve surgery; instead a hearing aid is fitted behind each ear, and the sounds on the side of the poor ear are wirelessly transmitted to the good ear.

The majority of previous studies comparing the BAHD to the CROS have used older CROS models with basic technology and a wire along the neck to send sounds from the poor ear to the good ear. There is a lack of studies comparing newer digital wireless CROS hearing aids to the BAHD. The current research will compare the effect of the BAHD and CROS hearing aid on speech perception scores when listening to speech in quiet and in noise. The research will also investigate participants' reported benefits with each device during everyday situations. In order to compare the BAHD and CROS, individuals who already have been implanted with a BAHD will be given a trial period with a new wireless digital CROS hearing aid.

The research hypothesis states that the CROS hearing aid will be as equally beneficial or greater than the BAHD in improving hearing and participant benefit. If the findings support the hypothesis that the CROS offers just as much benefits as the BAHD, or is an even better alternative, more individuals with SSD may choose to avoid surgery and decide to receive a CROS hearing aid instead.",Unilateral Hearing Loss,Device,CROS hearing aid

As a pragmatic intervention it is designed to be relatively simple, have broad inclusion/exclusion criteria, and be implemented across the Kaiser Permanente Colorado (KPCO) system. The intervention will have two components: a patient/care partner component focused on education and activation about potential deprescribing including sending out a brochure, and a clinician component focused on increasing clinician awareness through monthly Tip Sheets about options and processes for deprescribing in the ADRD-MCC population linked to upcoming visits. The intervention will take place at 18 primary care offices in the Denver-Boulder service delivery area with 9 as initial intervention sites and 9 as delayed intervention sites.",Dementia,Other,Educational Materials - Patient & Clinician
NCT02299284,2013-06-30,2015-06-30,Not Applicable,Intensive Home-based Bimanual and Lower-limb Training in Young Children With Hemiplegia,"A randomized control trial to test the efficacy of a new treatment involving intensive home-based bimanual training (Hand-Arm Bimanual Intensive Therapy (HABIT) and intensive home-based functional lower-limb training in children with hemiplegia. The protocols have been developed at TC Columbia University to be child friendly and draw upon the investigators experience since 1998 with intensive movement therapy in children with cerebral palsy. The aim is to promote either the use/coordination of movement of the hands or improve lower-limb balance, strength, and function. Caregivers will be trained at the investigator center and then be asked to do 2 hours per day, 5 days per week, for 9 weeks (90 hours total) of activities with their child in their own home. The activities will be supervised by the investigators team via computer. Participants do NOT need to live in the New York City area, but a one-time weekend visit to the investigators center is required for training. All measurement and treatment is performed in the home.

Participants are randomized to receive either HABIT or lower-limb training. If caregivers wish, they may chose to be crossed over at the end of the study and trained to receive the other treatment. PARTICIPATION IS FREE.

NCT03256851,2017-06-01,2018-07-31,Not Applicable,Telephone-Delivered Interventions to Target Multiple Sclerosis Fatigue,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive demyelinating disorder that damages white matter in the central nervous system. Although individuals experience mobility (e.g., walking, balance) impairments that lower quality of life and limit participation in daily activities, one of the most prominent symptoms is fatigue. Up to 92% of individuals report fatigue that manifests as lack of energy, exhaustion or worsening of MS symptoms and ultimately contributes to increasing disability. The currently available pharmaceutical treatments fail to fully control fatigue in the majority of individuals with MS; non-pharmacologic therapies such as exercise and behavioral therapies offer the best hope for combating MS fatigue in the majority of individuals.

Exercise therapy is effective in reducing MS fatigue. However, access to exercise therapy is seriously limited for many individuals with MS due to geographical location, limited resources (e.g., financial, transportation), and/or disability. Thus, the development and evaluation of an alternative delivery method for exercise therapy to target MS-related fatigue that increases participation and reduces barriers is critical.

Schizophrenia is associated with cognitive deficits that negatively impact essential areas of daily functioning. NY State Office of Mental Health (OMH) is the first and largest state system of care to implement a statewide program of cognitive remediation (CR), an evidence-based practice for improving cognition and aiding functional recovery. Through Cognitive Remediation to Promote Recovery (CR2PR), CR is now offered in outpatient programs, with plans to expand to more services and further adapt implementation to improve treatment outcomes. This project will work directly with OMH clinics and clinicians to build upon and improve current CR delivery methods. This project will study the impact of two adaptations. One focuses on increasing the accessibility of the program, which participants report is limited by the requirement of twice weekly attendance. This project will compare the feasibility and acceptability of delivering CR in either two clinic-based sessions (Clinic) or one clinic and one remote session (Hybrid) per week. Qualitative interviews will be conducted with stakeholders to explore the impact of the adaptation. The second adaptation is intended to improve personalization of CR by systematically accounting for individual differences in neurocognitive needs. Drawing upon convergent evidence for tailoring CR based on need for early auditory processing (EAP) training, this project examines whether integrating a measure of EAP into the current baseline assessment facilitates personalization of the menu of restorative computer-based exercises used in CR. Feasibility parameters and qualitative/quantitative data analyses of facilitators and barriers to Hybrid CR delivery will together inform further treatment refinement and the design of a larger effectiveness trial of Clinic versus Hybrid CR. This project will examine how EAP assessment is employed by practitioners to personalize the CR treatment plan and examine if EAP improvement is associated with cognitive outcomes in public practice CR settings.

Schizophrenia is associated with cognitive deficits that negatively impact essential areas of daily functioning. NY State Office of Mental Health (OMH) is the first and largest state system of care to implement a statewide program of cognitive remediation (CR), an evidence-based practice for improving cognition and aiding functional recovery. Through Cognitive Remediation to Promote Recovery (CR2PR), CR is now offered in outpatient programs, with plans to expand to more services and further adapt implementation to improve treatment outcomes. This project will work directly with OMH clinics and clinicians to build upon and improve current CR delivery methods. This project will study the impact of two adaptations. One focuses on increasing the accessibility of the program, which participants report is limited by the requirement of twice weekly attendance. This project will compare the feasibility and acceptability of delivering CR in either two clinic-based sessions (Clinic) or one clinic and one remote session (Hybrid) per week.

NCT00995553,2010-01-31,2015-12-31,Not Applicable,Remediation of Working Memory in Schizophrenia,"The primary aim of the study is to test the efficacy of a novel cognitive remediation intervention that targets working memory-related functions. To accomplish this goal, 80 volunteer patients with schizophrenia will be enrolled and randomized to either a cognitive remediation condition that targets working memory or a computer skills training intervention that teaches computer applications. In both conditions participants will receive computer training three times a week for 4 months. The investigators hypothesize that patients who receive the cognitive remediation intervention will demonstrate significantly greater change on neuropsychological measures of working memory and executive abilities than patients who receive the computer skills course. In addition, the investigators hypothesize that the intervention-induced cognitive change will be associated with concurrent improvements in functional capacity and psychosocial functioning in the community. A second study goal is to examine the stability of the intervention-induced changes in cognition. Cognition and psychosocial functioning will be reassessed 4 and 8 months after treatment termination to examine the stability of treatment effects and to assess whether a less intense maintenance training (once a week sessions) provides any additional benefit to participants. Lastly, this study will examine in an exploratory manner whether there are individual differences in treatment response. The Val158Met polymorphism of the COMT gene has been found to be associated with working memory and prefrontal dysfunction in schizophrenia. The study will test whether the COMT polymorphism is predictive of response to cognitive remediation.",Schizophrenia,Behavioral,Cognitive Remediation

NCT01019343,2009-12-08,2020-10-09,Not Applicable,Physiological Investigations of Movement Disorders,"Background:

Previous studies have given researchers information on how the brain controls movement, how people learn to make fine, skilled movements, and why some people have movement disorders. However, further research is needed to learn more about the causes of most movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease.
By using small, specialized studies to evaluate people with movement disorders and compare them with healthy volunteers, researchers hope to learn more about the changes in the brain and possible causes of movement disorders.

Previous studies showed a conclusive link between SAHS and severe cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, myocardial infarction, heart failure and stroke.Then, SAHS is a public health issue in adults.

In this context, early detection of such a disease is crucial if the management is tailored to the patient, the practitioner's choice of therapy moving towards continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or mandibular advancement device. The detection is based on full nocturnal polysomnography or polygraphic recordings. Polysomnography remains the gold standard but it is a time consuming and costly examination. Polygraphic recording is a test that allows simplified the diagnosis of severe patients, but may not be sufficient for mild form of SAHS. Thus, the SAHS is a pathology under-diagnosed and under-treated. The validation of a technique for identifying patients most at risk to either limit the number of polysomnographic examination is requested.",Sleep Apnea Syndromes,Device,VistaO2 device

Aim 1. Develop a staged and modifiable dyadic oral care intervention to provide functionally-tailored oral care rehabilitation for community-dwelling persons with dementia (PWD) and need-based skills training their family caregivers (CGs). Based on the literature review and MCWB, a 4-week intervention with 8 modules, including universal modules (e.g., environmental changes), CG modules (e.g., cuing strategies) and modules for both PWD and CGs (e.g., oral care techniques), will be developed addressing the relevant SCT constructs (e.g., functional deficits of PWD and caregiving needs of CGs). Guided by a validated, widely-used theory of rehabilitation medicine, modules will be used alone or in combination to provide personalized, hand-on, functionally-tailored oral care rehabilitation for PWD along with skills training for CGs to match their caregiving needs. The training focus shifts from the PWD to the CG, as the independence of the PWD decreases. Semi-structured interviews with family CGs will then be conducted (until data saturation is reached) to understand their oral care needs, desired intervention approaches, and the perceived feasibility and utility of the intervention. The intervention will be revised and then pilot tested with 4 dyads, one per each of the four functional levels of the DAT.

Aim 2. Evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of the intervention in home settings through a randomized, controlled trial with 40 pairs of PWD and their primary CGs, including immediate post-intervention and 3-month follow-up. Dyads will be stratified into 4 functional levels based on the PWD's DAT score and then randomly assigned to the intervention or control (non-tailored usual care) group.",Dementia,Behavioral,Functionally Tailored Oral Care Intervention

Since the functional prognosis of the upper hemiplegic limb remains mostly unfavourable, a wide range of interventions should be proposed. There is currently a consensus to consider the use of transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) stimulation in functional recovery after stroke as a method to enhance the effectiveness of training techniques. Although all motor therapies can theoretically benefit from increased effectiveness by the addition of transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS), Computerized Mirror Therapy (CMT) has a high potential for sensitivity to transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) due to the intensity of the motor training of the upper limb applied.",Stroke,Diagnostic Test,Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS)
NCT01544738,2008-11-30,,Not Applicable,Aponeurotic Stimulation Effect on Parkinson Bradykinesia,"Movement slowness (bradykinesia) is one of the main motor symptoms in Parkinson Disease (PD). Several studies have shown that patients with PD exhibit slowness because they are unable to modulate, in an optimal way, the velocity of voluntary motor acts not induced by external stimulation. Indeed, these patients have difficulties to integrate multi-sensorial information, mainly proprioception.

The investigators investigated changes in shoulder velocity during pointing movements by patients with PD after stimulation of soft tissues (aponeurosis) of upper limb muscles. The stimulation consisted of manipulating, with a hook (the diacutaneous fibrolysis method), the aponeurotic tissues enrobing the heads of the upper limb muscles. This technique has previously been shown to decrease passive tension and the tendon reflex response of the manipulated muscle group. The investigators hypothesis is that aponeurotic manipulation of shoulder muscles therefore creates a modification in the proprioceptive information, which in return temporarily decreases the bradykinesia of shoulder movements.",Parkinson Disease,Other,Aponeurotic stimulation (the diacutaneous fibrolysis method)

NCT01548781,2012-03-31,2015-07-31,Not Applicable,The Effect of Resistance to Participant-Supported Reaching on Workspace of the Hand in Severe Chronic Stroke,"Disturbances in movement coordination are the least well understood but often the most debilitating with respect to functional recovery following stroke. These deficits in coordination are expressed in the form of abnormal muscle synergies and result in limited and stereotypic movement patterns that are functionally disabling. The result of these constraints in muscle synergies is an abnormal coupling between shoulder abduction and elbow flexion (i.e. the flexion synergy), which significantly reduces the reaching function of an individual with stroke when they lift up the weight of the impaired arm against gravity. The investigators previous neurotherapeutic research, supported by a NIDRR Field Initiated research grant, has shown that the abnormal synergy between shoulder abduction and elbow flexion can be significantly reduced thus increasing total reaching range of motion in individuals with severe stroke. The previous work established progressive abduction loading as a key element to the rehabilitation of reaching. Although individuals with severe stroke benefited from the investigators previous work, residual flexion synergy continued to hinder normal arm function in most participants with severe stroke. This study will utilize the ACT3D robot, developed as part of the investigators previous NIDRR project, to incorporate resistance to reaching while accounting for the known benefits of progressive abduction loading. The investigators propose to randomize forty participants with severe stroke into two closely related interventions. The groups will both practice reaching under abduction loading, however, the experimental group will also move against resistance while reaching. Rigorous and quantitative investigation of therapeutic elements such as resistance to reaching and progressive abduction loading is only possible with a device such as the ACT3D. the investigators will be able to standardize the delivery of each intervention using kinematic and kinetic parameters, which will allow for a clear identification of the therapeutic effect of resistance to reaching. the investigators hypothesize that resistance to reaching in combination with progressive abduction loading will further increase dynamic multi-joint strength, increase total reaching range of motion, and increase arm function thus enhancing actual amount of use of the arm, participation in life roles, and quality of life in individuals with severe stroke.",Stroke,Behavioral,Impairment-based robotic intervention for reaching function
NCT03025464,2017-11-14,2019-03-31,Phase 2,"Wireless Sensor Patch for Educing Barriers to In-home Sleep Apnea Screening, Phase II","Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common type of sleep apnea. The marketplace currently does not have an affordable, easy-to-use, over-the-counter, home-based OSA screening device. An affordable, available, FDA-approved and easy-to-use over-the-counter OSA screening tool would allow greater screening of at-risk individuals, especially in underserved communities with low socioeconomic status, hopefully encouraging a greater proportion of such individuals to seek treatment for their condition. Over the past year, this investigative team has engineered a small screening device (Zerify®) for OSA and obtained preliminary evidence of its efficacy in a clinical population under a NIMHD-sponsored Phase I STTR award. Phase I Specific Aims 1 and 2 focused on developing a small (1.5 x 2.5 x 0.2 inches) semiconductor sensor that could store sound/motion data, transfer these data to a computer, and detect non-clinical simulated apnea events with a specificity and specificity exceeding 90%. Phase I Specific Aim 3 established the preliminary psychometric performance data of the screening device in a clinical sample of 52 patients (13% African American, 6% Asian, 4% Mixed or Other Race) against gold-standard polysomnography. Phase II proposal aims to optimize the engineered hardware and associated OSA algorithms, create a patient companion app and wireless healthcare provider dashboard, and compare the efficacy of this screening device to the most commonly utilized sleep apnea screener, the home sleep apnea test (HSAT).",Obstructive Sleep Apnea,Device,Obstructive Sleep Apnea Screening Device

The investigators use the RNA-seq technique to analyze the gene expression levels and potential alternate transcripts, including long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), in muscle tissue samples. The gene expression profiles will point to the genes of interest that can then become the object of future studies, in which epigenetic changes of these genes will be explored further. The value of those possible biomarkers will be assessed.

NCT02191267,2015-01-31,2016-09-30,Phase 2,Tau Imaging of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a progressive degenerative brain disease with symptoms that include memory loss, problems with impulse control, and depression that can lead to suicide. As the disease progresses, it can lead to dementia. Currently CTE can only be diagnosed postmortem where an over-accumulation of a protein called tau is observed. There is now a new experimental measure that makes it possible, for the first time, to measure tau protein in the living human brain using a novel positron emission tomography (PET) ligand, [F-18] AV-1451 (aka, [18F]-T807).

The main objective of this study is to use a novel PET approach to measure tau accumulation in the brain. The presence of CTE at autopsy in deceased National Football League (NFL) players has been well documented. Accordingly, we will conduct this study in a group of retired NFL players who have clinical symptoms of CTE and are suspected of having CTE based on high levels of tau in their spinal fluid and abnormalities seen on research brain scans. We will compare them with a control group of former elite level athletes who have not experienced any brain trauma, deny any clinical symptoms, and who have completely normal spinal fluid tau and amyloid levels, and brain scans. We will also include a group of subjects with AD. All participants will be recruited from ongoing studies, headed by the Partnering PI of this proposal, Dr. Robert Stern, at the Boston University Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy and the Alzheimer's Disease Center. We will use both a beta amyloid PET scan ([18F]-florbetapir) and a tau PET scan ([18F]-T807) on consecutive days. With the beta amyloid scan we expect little or no evidence of amyloid in the NFL players with presumed CTE, and no evidence of amyloid in the control group of athletes with no history of repetitive brain trauma. In contrast we expect to see beta amyloid accumulation in the AD patient brains. With the new tau ligand, we expect that the NFL players with presumed CTE will show elevated levels of tau protein in the brain, which will not be observed in athletes without a history of brain trauma, but which will be seen in the AD patients' brains.

Another goal is to use the latest MRI technologies to develop specific tau imaging biomarkers that correlate with the PET and spinal fluid tau measures but without the radiation of PET or invasiveness of spinal taps. The development of these surrogate imaging markers of tau, is critically important to diagnosing CTE. This in turn will lead to studies relevant to treatment and prevention of this devastating disease. Finally, as an exploratory method of examining possible genetic risk for CTE, we will also use cutting edge genetic analysis of blood samples from subjects in this proposal and compare tau load, measured by PET tau ligand uptake and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) p-tau level, with a measure of genetic susceptibility to tau load, referred to as the genetic risk score for tau.",Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy,Radiation,[F18]-T807

NCT03628261,2019-07-23,2022-03-01,Not Applicable,Is EMG-based Serious Games Effective in Improving Gait in Children With Cerebral Palsy ? Interest of Electromyography Feedback (EMG),"Cerebral palsy (CP) is a major motor dysfunction manifesting early in childhood, with severe consequences to performance in daily functions. CP children are typically unable to voluntarily activate individual muscles, hindering motor coordination and therefore the ability to produce movements as smooth as those seen in control cohorts. Muscles spanning distal joints are more likely affected by CP, resulting in abnormal gait patterns.

While commercially available and customised games have been considered for CP rehabilitation in the last decade, they are mainly based on the analysis of movement kinematics and none seems to deal directly with the key source of motor impairment: the skeletal muscle. Surface electromyograms (EMGs), on the other hand, provide clinicians with the possibility of directly assessing and controlling the neural drive or command to muscles.

The benefits of surface EMG as a feedback tool for improving posture control and for stroke rehabilitation are well established.

The treatment with EMG-based ""serious games"" is expected to assist CP children in activating the ankle muscles in both paretic and healthy limbs at similar instants within the gait cycle. Given such EMG-oriented rehabilitation applies directly to the muscle, its effect on muscle and therefore gait function is likely to be greater than that achieved with conventional means. If this hypothesis is verified, it will be further expect to observe a smoother gait, that is smoother changes in gait kinematics and morphology of the paretic foot, in CP children treated with EMG-based serious game than otherwise.

Primary objective consists in verifying whether Surface electromyography (sEMG)-based games are effective in reducing the degree of muscular hyperactivity in the ankle plantar flexor and thus improve the ankle dorsi flexor function in children with cerebral palsy.

The study design is an open, prospective, monocentric, randomized and controlled trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the first group or to the second group.

For the first group, the design will be: ""physical therapy + serious games"" during the first month then ""physical therapy"" during the second month.

For second group, the the design will be: ""physical therapy"" during the first month then ""physical therapy + serious games"" during the second month.",Cerebral Palsy,Device,Serious Game
NCT03628261,2019-07-23,2022-03-01,Not Applicable,Is EMG-based Serious Games Effective in Improving Gait in Children With Cerebral Palsy ? Interest of Electromyography Feedback (EMG),"Cerebral palsy (CP) is a major motor dysfunction manifesting early in childhood, with severe consequences to performance in daily functions. CP children are typically unable to voluntarily activate individual muscles, hindering motor coordination and therefore the ability to produce movements as smooth as those seen in control cohorts. Muscles spanning distal joints are more likely affected by CP, resulting in abnormal gait patterns.

While commercially available and customised games have been considered for CP rehabilitation in the last decade, they are mainly based on the analysis of movement kinematics and none seems to deal directly with the key source of motor impairment: the skeletal muscle. Surface electromyograms (EMGs), on the other hand, provide clinicians with the possibility of directly assessing and controlling the neural drive or command to muscles.

Specifically the aim is to develop and implement a robotic exoskeleton and brain computer interface to assist and eventually perform arm and hand movement in patients with the progressive neurodegenerative disease ALS. This proposal brings together state-of-the-art robotic technology, EEG-based brain computer interface (BCI) know-how, clinical expertise, patient perspective and industrial partners to develop and implement a robotic arm/hand device that will adapt, with increasing brain-computer control, based on the need of the patient. In short the BCI will measure electroencephalography (EEG) from the surface of the scalp and recognize signature EEG as the patient intents to move. As the patient loses muscle power the BCI robotic-device will gradually take over and support motor activity, even when the patient is totally paralyzed. As the device supports hand/arm function only, the investigators aim to address ADLs associated to hand function, specifically eating activities.",Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis,Device,REMAP EEG based BCI and SEM-Glove BioServo

NCT02118701,2014-01-31,,Not Applicable,SHARED DECISION MAKING ON A 'LIFE-AND-CARE PLAN' IN LONG-TERM CARE FACILITIES,"Shared Decision Making (SDM) is defined as a process where healthcare professionals and patients make decisions together, using the best available evidence. SDM, as a communication and decision method, can be used also with persons suffering from dementia. Yet, SDM with persons with dementia or even with their family caregivers is not widespread.

The present research project aims to develop and evaluate an SDM framework in care planning to be implemented in long-term care facilities, in order to obtain a constantly developing care plan that focuses not only on the medical, physical, psychosocial and spiritual needs of the resident, but that considers and documents his preferences and the actions taken by caregivers to meet them.

The current project is a controlled exploratory study. Case studies that involve a triad in each case, composed by the resident with moderate or severe dementia, his family caregiver and the professional usually taking care for the resident, will be used (n=16 professionals; n=40 residents; n=40 family caregivers). Professional caregivers of two nursing homes, one located in Italy and one in the Netherlands, will receive a specific training in SDM principles and will guide the SDM interview within the triad. Primary outcome will be the proportion of residents whose preferences and needs, together with the related actions to meet them, are known, documented and satisfied in their 'life-and-care plans'. Secondary outcomes are the residents' and family caregivers' quality of life; the family caregivers' sense of competence and the healthcare professionals' job satisfaction. Semi-structured interviews and focus group interviews will be performed to assess satisfaction with the intervention and barriers and facilitators to its implementation. Assessments are performed at baseline and six months after the intervention.

We hypothesize that the use of the SDM process in care planning will increase the number of met needs and will improve the residents' and family caregivers quality of life, the family caregivers' sense of competence and the healthcare professionals' job satisfaction.

The key element of this study is that it will contribute to our knowledge about the efficacy and feasibility of an SDM framework in care planning in long-term care facilities with persons with moderate to severe dementia.",Dementia,Other,Shared Decision-Making educational training

Our goal is to prospectively study the effects of oral midodrine on the signs and symptoms of orthostatic hypotension in 20 patients and the effects of intravenous fluid on the signs of symptoms of orthostatic hypotension in 10 patients. Midodrine will be administered to patients with suspected low SVV, and an intravenous fluid bolus will be administered to patients with low CO. 120 patients will be consented with a view to studying 30 patients who meet the inclusion criteria for orthostatic hypotension. Patients who receive midodrine or the fluid bolus will undergo hemodynamic measurements at 30 min, 1 hr, 2 hrs, 3 hrs, and 4 hrs post-intervention. All patients will undergo measurements for blood pressure, arterial augmentation index, and heart rate at baseline (pre-op; holding area) and the time of first PT attempt. Patients will be monitored up to post-operative day 3. The working hypothesis is that midodrine or fluid therapy will significantly raise the mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) by 5 mmHg+ and/or cause a significant change in the Orthostatic Hypotension Questionnaire (characterized by a two-point improvement in symptom score).",Orthostatic Hypotension,Other,Intravenous fluid bolus

NCT03031223,2016-08-31,2017-05-31,Not Applicable,"Evaluation of Sensory-motor Response to Low-level Laser Therapy for the Treatment of Spinal Injuries - Protocol for a Randomized, Controlled, Clinical Trial","Spinal cord injuries have become increasingly frequent due mainly to the increase in urban violence. The growing number of automobile collisions and violence-related events merits particular attention, as such occurrences can lead to death or disability stemming from a spinal injury. The severity of the consequences depends on the location affected and degree of destruction of afferent and efferent spinal cord pathways, with higher, more extensive injuries leading to less physical fitness and functional independence. Unfortunately, injured neurons of the central nervous system are unable to regenerate following a spinal injury and spinal cord regeneration is therefore a major challenge to researchers in the fields of neuroscience and neurologia. Upon receiving an external stimulus, the central nervous system is believed to adapt and reorganize itself using mechanisms to compensate for neuronal loss and promote, even if partially, the remodeling of remaining synaptic connections, leading to new neuronal sprouting. Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) has proven to be a possible option for the stimulation of the repair process in the central nervous system. It is plausible that this type of therapy can offer the same benefits previously established in other types of tissues, the stimulation of bone formation, neovascularization and the regeneration of peripheral nerves. Research groups have investigated the efficacy of LLLT for the treatment of spinal cord injuries and have demonstrated that laser therapy administered simultaneously to an injured sciatic nerve and corresponding segment of the spinal cord accelerates the regeneration process of the injured peripheral nerve.",Spinal Cord Injuries,Radiation,low-level laser therapy

NCT05390268,2022-04-30,2025-12-31,Not Applicable,Mobile App-assisted Behavioral Treatment (MA-BT) in Children and Adolescents With an Impairing Tic Disorder. Randomized Clinical Trial Evaluating Treatment Response and Satisfaction,"Chronic tic disorders are neurodevelopmental disorders affecting 0.5-1% of children and adolescents. Tics present as sudden, rapid, repetitive non-rhythmic movements or vocalizations or a combination. Tics may be extremely distressing in a child's life, but the severity of tics is often variable. The group of children/ adolescents with tic disorders are heterogenous when it comes to symptom presentation, comorbid conditions and social status. This places great demands on professionals to offer the right treatment at the right time. The aim of the current project is to make optimal tics training more accessible, including for patients managed in primary care, to make optimal treatment available in the immediate environment, and to ensure increased adherence to treatment.

As part of this project, an app has been developed and the study aims to evaluate mobile app-assisted behavioral treatment as an efficient and feasible approach that may be a valuable tool together with other treatment approaches. The mobile app-assisted training is based on the manual ""Niks til Tics"", which describes training with a combination of Habit Reversal Training (HRT) and Exposure Response Prevention (ERP) over nine sessions. Both HRT and ERP are known to be effective treatments of tics.

In this project a randomized controlled superiority trial evaluates the effect of app-assisted training versus an educational approach. Participants are randomized to manualised treatment combining HRT and ERP as app-assisted training, or to one session of psychoeducation supplemented with access to videos repeating the information. The participants are included according to the same criteria as in a pilot trial, and primary outcome measure is YGTSS at session 8. Furthermore, the change in tics intensity from baseline to randomization will be included as to evaluate the effect of being admitted and examined at the hospital.

This project contributes to increased knowledge about tics and tic treatment especially treatment using digital based interventions. An app has been developed for this project and the hypothesis is that a mobile app-assisted tic training program requiring minimal hospital contacts is superior to app-based psychoeducation alone, which is the most likely intervention that these patients will be offered.",Tic Disorders,Behavioral,Mobile app-assisted behavioral treatment
NCT01223781,2011-01-31,2012-05-31,Not Applicable,Biofeedback-based Motor Learning to Ameliorate Freezing of Gait,"Objective/Rationale:

The investigators objective is to demonstrate that an intervention program based on motor learning principles can be applied to train subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD) who suffer from freezing to walk in a way that minimizes the occurrence of freezing. Since sufficient motor learning capabilities are preserved in PD, the investigators hypothesize that an intervention program that targets the time periods just prior to an approaching freezing episode can modify the walking strategies so that the episode will now be averted.

Project Description:

The freezing burden will be quantified in subjects with PD before and after 6 weeks of training. Two types of interventions (20 subjects in each group) will be tested: 1) Open-loop group (OLG); 2) Closed-loop group (CLG). Each session of the OLG training includes walking courses aimed at provoking freezing episodes. The experimenter will trigger an auditory rhythmic stimulation (RAS) in walking conditions likely to invoke freezing (e.g., turning) and the subject will learn to synchronize his/her gait with the auditory cues, i.e., to keep the walking pace and coordination and, as a result, to avoid freezing. Similar principles will apply for the CLG training; however, the RAS will be elicited automatically by a device that recognizes an approaching freezing episode.

Relevance to Diagnosis/Treatment of Parkinson's Disease:

If even partially successful, the investigators will show, for the first time that freezing of gait is amenable to motor learning and that appropriate training with external cueing can alleviate these motor blockades. While future studies will be needed to further assess long-term efficacy and other important questions about clinical efficacy and the mechanisms involved, this study should go a long way towards improving the investigators understanding of freezing of gait and its amenability to appropriate therapy.

Anticipated Outcome:

The investigators anticipate that after intensive training, the central nervous system (CNS) of subjects with PD will be able to anticipate impending freezing episodes based on awareness of the environmental conditions (e.g., an approaching turn) and/or based on sub-conscious response to a deteriorating gait pattern. As a result, an automated motor response that paces and coordinates gait will be internally triggered by the CNS and the approaching freezing episode will be averted. The overall freezing burden will therefore decrease in trained subjects.",Gait,Behavioral,Biofeedback-based motor learning for PD

Sensorial perception tests will be carried out in accordance with a standardized procedure (Rolke et al. Pain, 2006). For non-implanted patients, an initial visit will be conducted before the operation. For all participants, two other visits will take place at least 6 months after the operation to perform the tests with and without stimulation.",Failed Back Surgery Syndrome,Procedure,Implantation of a spinal cord stimulator

VIIIth Nerve tumors with documented growth on serial MRI scans typically lead to deafness in the affected ear over time. Radiation (Gamma Knife® or stereotactic radiosurgery) may preserve hearing in ~80% while surgery (middle cranial fossa or retrosigmoid approach) may preserve hearing in 16 - 40% of small tumors, although initial hearing preservation by both modalities may fail over time. Surgical resection via the translabyrinthine approach is the safest way to remove many of these tumors, but involves loss of all hearing. In all treatment modalities, the vascular supply (the labyrinthine artery, a terminal branch of AICA with no collaterals) to the cochlea is at risk. After devascularization, the cochlea frequently fills with fibrous tissue or ossifies (labyrinthitis ossificans), making it impossible to place a cochlear implant should it be required later.

NCT05209386,2022-05-02,2023-12-31,Not Applicable,Flexible Representation of Speech in the Supratemporal Plane,"The overarching goal of this exploratory research is to understand the dynamic and flexible nature of speech processing in the human supratemporal plane. The temporal lobe has long been established as a region of interest in the speech perception and processing literature because it contains the auditory cortex. More recently, research has localized the supratemporal plane as an area that exhibits response specificity to acoustic properties of complex auditory signals like speech. The supratemporal plane, comprised of Heschl's gyrus, the planum polare, and the planum temporale, is capable of the rapid spectrotemporal analysis required to map acoustic information to linguistic representation. Neural activity in this area, however, is rarely studied directly because it is difficult to access with non-invasive measures like scalp electroencephalography (EEG). Capitalizing on the unique opportunity to access these areas via routine clinical stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) in a patient population, this study seeks to understand how cortical responses reflect the diagnosticity of two acoustic-phonetic dimensions of interest and how responses rapidly and flexibly adapt to changes in listening demands. Examining how neural response to voice onset time (VOT) and fundamental frequency (F0) modulates as a function of perceptual weight carried in signaling phoneme categories, and identifying how changes in listening context shift perceptual weight, will provide invaluable data that indicates how speech processing flexibly adapts to short-term acoustic patterns.",Epilepsy,Behavioral,Dimension-Based Statistical Learning
NCT03199833,2016-11-10,2018-05-31,Not Applicable,Reaching Training Based on Robotic Hybrid Assistance for Stroke Patients,"Stroke is the third most common cause of death and the main cause of acquired adult disability in high-income countries. The most common deficit after stroke is motor impairment of the contralateral arm, with more than 80% of stroke survivors experiencing this condition in the acute phase, and only half regaining some useful upper limb function after six months.

Within the European project RETRAINER (grant agreement No 644721), the consortium developed a platform for the rehabilitation of the upper limb after stroke, which combines a passive forearm-hand orthosis for hand-wrist motion stabilization, selective fingers constraining and grasp movement facilitation, Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) of the extrinsic hand flexor muscles and of the extrinsic hand extensor muscles, interactive objects, and voluntary effort. The system also provides a graphical user interface which helps the therapist set the training session and save the training data and parameters, and provides the subject a visual feedback about his/her active involvement in the exercise. The training consists of the execution of a series of exercises involving the affected arm during daily life activities. Typical exercises include controlled wrist flexion and extension, controlled fingers flexion and extension, anterior reaching and grasping on a plane or in the space, moving an object on a plane or in the space.

The aim of this clinical study it to evaluate the efficacy of this novel training platform on patients between two weeks and nine months after their first stroke, who preserved at least a visible muscle contraction for the arm and shoulder muscles. Participants are randomized in an experimental and a control group. The control group is trained with an advanced rehabilitative program, including physical training, occupational therapy, FES, and virtual reality, while the experimental group is trained with the RETRAINER system for about 30 minutes, in addition to the same program of the control group. The daily training time is the same for the two groups. The intervention consists of three sessions a week for nine weeks. Patients are assessed at baseline, soon after the end of the intervention, and in a 4-week follow-up visits. It is planned to recruit 68 subjects for this study. Since the RETRAINER platform was built on the up-to-date theory of motor re-learning, which supports task-oriented repetitive training, a close temporal association between motor intention and stimulated motor response, and an intensive and frequent training paradigm, the study's hypothesis is that the experimental group shows a greater treatment effect than the control group.",Stroke,Device,RETRAINER-S2
NCT03199833,2016-11-10,2018-05-31,Not Applicable,Reaching Training Based on Robotic Hybrid Assistance for Stroke Patients,"Stroke is the third most common cause of death and the main cause of acquired adult disability in high-income countries. The most common deficit after stroke is motor impairment of the contralateral arm, with more than 80% of stroke survivors experiencing this condition in the acute phase, and only half regaining some useful upper limb function after six months.

Within the European project RETRAINER (grant agreement No 644721), the consortium developed a platform for the rehabilitation of the upper limb after stroke, which combines a passive forearm-hand orthosis for hand-wrist motion stabilization, selective fingers constraining and grasp movement facilitation, Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) of the extrinsic hand flexor muscles and of the extrinsic hand extensor muscles, interactive objects, and voluntary effort. The system also provides a graphical user interface which helps the therapist set the training session and save the training data and parameters, and provides the subject a visual feedback about his/her active involvement in the exercise. The training consists of the execution of a series of exercises involving the affected arm during daily life activities. Typical exercises include controlled wrist flexion and extension, controlled fingers flexion and extension, anterior reaching and grasping on a plane or in the space, moving an object on a plane or in the space.

The aim of this clinical study it to evaluate the efficacy of this novel training platform on patients between two weeks and nine months after their first stroke, who preserved at least a visible muscle contraction for the arm and shoulder muscles. Participants are randomized in an experimental and a control group. The control group is trained with an advanced rehabilitative program, including physical training, occupational therapy, FES, and virtual reality, while the experimental group is trained with the RETRAINER system for about 30 minutes, in addition to the same program of the control group. The daily training time is the same for the two groups. The intervention consists of three sessions a week for nine weeks. Patients are assessed at baseline, soon after the end of the intervention, and in a 4-week follow-up visits. It is planned to recruit 68 subjects for this study. Since the RETRAINER platform was built on the up-to-date theory of motor re-learning, which supports task-oriented repetitive training, a close temporal association between motor intention and stimulated motor response, and an intensive and frequent training paradigm, the study's hypothesis is that the experimental group shows a greater treatment effect than the control group.",Stroke,Other,Conventional therapy

NCT01841840,2012-01-31,2012-07-31,Not Applicable,The Acute Effects of Passive Vibration on Cardiovascular Function in Individuals With Stroke,"Stroke is the third leading cause of death in the United States. Of those who are affected by stroke, a third becomes permanently disabled. Risk factors for stroke include, but are not limited to, advancing age, physical inactivity, arterial stiffness, and most commonly, high blood pressure. Stroke is a major form of a much boarder problem, cardiovascular disease (CVD). CVD is considered the primary cause of death in the US. Interestingly, increased arterial stiffness of elastic arteries (carotid and aorta) has been shown to be strongly correlated to CVD and stroke. Increased arterial stiffness is considered an independent risk for the development of CVD and stroke. Hence, arterial stiffness has been suggested as a potential therapeutic target for CVD and more specifically stroke.

Recently, whole-body vibration (WBV) exercise has been proposed as a new and effective method to improve muscle mass and muscle strength in younger and older individuals. It is known that systemic arterial stiffness decreased 40 min after a single WBV session in healthy men. In our laboratory, we have shown that leg arterial stiffness decreases after a session of WBV. Taken together, this data seems to suggest WBV may be used as a viable way to decrease arterial stiffness. Special populations, such as post-stroke patients, may be unwilling or unable to perform WBV exercise so an inactive form of exercise (vibration) therapy is needed.

Passive vibration (PV), allows patients to lie in an inactive, supine position, with their legs placed onto the vibration plate. This exposes the lower limbs to continuous vibration without performing voluntary muscle contraction. PV has been shown to increase skin blood flow on the vibrated extremity through vasodilation in healthy individuals and type 2 diabetics. Previous work in our laboratory has demonstrated that a 10-min session of PV on the legs decreases augmentation index (AIx) , a marker of pressure wave reflection, as well as leg and systemic PWV through decreases in local peripheral resistance in young men. However, the effects of PV on arterial function in post-stroke patients are unknown.

It is hypothesized that post-stroke patients will demonstrate a decrease in leg PWV and central AIx. However, greater responses are expected with the lower vibration frequency.",Stroke,Other,Low-Frequency Passive Vibration

Increased arterial stiffness is considered an independent risk for the development of CVD and stroke. Hence, arterial stiffness has been suggested as a potential therapeutic target for CVD and more specifically stroke.

Recently, whole-body vibration (WBV) exercise has been proposed as a new and effective method to improve muscle mass and muscle strength in younger and older individuals. It is known that systemic arterial stiffness decreased 40 min after a single WBV session in healthy men. In our laboratory, we have shown that leg arterial stiffness decreases after a session of WBV. Taken together, this data seems to suggest WBV may be used as a viable way to decrease arterial stiffness. Special populations, such as post-stroke patients, may be unwilling or unable to perform WBV exercise so an inactive form of exercise (vibration) therapy is needed.

Passive vibration (PV), allows patients to lie in an inactive, supine position, with their legs placed onto the vibration plate. This exposes the lower limbs to continuous vibration without performing voluntary muscle contraction. PV has been shown to increase skin blood flow on the vibrated extremity through vasodilation in healthy individuals and type 2 diabetics. Previous work in our laboratory has demonstrated that a 10-min session of PV on the legs decreases augmentation index (AIx) , a marker of pressure wave reflection, as well as leg and systemic PWV through decreases in local peripheral resistance in young men. However, the effects of PV on arterial function in post-stroke patients are unknown.

It is hypothesized that post-stroke patients will demonstrate a decrease in leg PWV and central AIx. However, greater responses are expected with the lower vibration frequency.",Pre-Hypertension,Other,Low-Frequency Passive Vibration

NCT05670158,2023-01-31,2026-07-31,Not Applicable,Study on the Inner Ear Immunisation Post-cohlear Implantation and Perilymph Molecular Profiling in Sensorineural Hearing Loss,"Many patients receiving cochlear implant (CI) have some residual hearing prior to implantation surgery. However, approximately one third of them will lose it in next 6 months after cochlear implantation. Although the mechanisms involved in the residual audition loss remain unknown, animal experiments suggest the role of inflammatory or immune reaction in the cochlea. The goal of this project is to search in the perilymph (a fluid which fills the scala vestibuli and scala tympani of the cochlea) some predictive biomarkers of the residual hearing loss using modern proteomics and immunological techniques. A parallel search for blood biomarkers of post-implantation residual hearing loss and for molecular and cellular evidences of immune response to cochlear implantation will be performed.

The study will recruit 50 subjects-candidates for cochlear implantation surgery; 30 normally hearing individuals eligible for other types of otological interventions will form a control group. For all the participants blood samples will be collected and preserved. In addition, the perilymph sampling will be performed during cochlear implantation surgery.

This project relies on the calculation that from 50 patients post-cochlear implantation, 15 patients will form a group with maintained residual hearing and 15 will display delayed hearing loss. For these 30 subjects together with the control group the blood biomarkers search will be performed.

For the group of implanted patients, the follow-up will last for 12 months with 6 visits in total :

the inclusion visit V0 during which the study will be presented and the consent form will be signed
the surgery visit V1 with blood sample and perilymph collection
the activation visit V2, 1 month ± 1 week after V1, visit V3 3 months ± 7 days after V1, V4 6 months ± 7 days after V1, V5 12 months ± 1 month after V1. During each of this visit blood sampling will be performed.

For the control group, the follow up will be 6 months long with 4 visits in total arranged during the routine follow-up appointments:

NCT00472862,2007-01-31,2010-04-30,Phase 3,NEUROCOM: Cognitive Training for Patients With First Episode Schizophrenia,"The study examines the effect of cognitive training on cognitive functioning and everyday competencies of patients with schizophrenia.

120 patients are expected to be included in this randomized controlled trial running at two sites in Denmark starting January 2007 The effect of a 16-week, manualized program of cognitive training integrated in a comprehensive psychosocial treatment (OPUS) for first-episode schizophrenia patients is compared with the effect of standard treatment (OPUS). A six month follow-up assessment is conducted to investigate a possible long-term learning effect of cognitive training.

Blinded assessments include the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery and a co-primary outcome measure of cognitive improvement: A translated version of the UCSD Performance-based Skills Assessment (UPSA) adjusted to a Danish context.

The cognitive training consists of four modules focusing on the domain of attention, executive functioning, learning and memory. Module 1 and 2 are based on computer-assisted training tasks, and the following modules focus on more practical everyday tasks and calendar training. Cognitive training takes place twice a week and every other week the patient and trainer engage in a dialogue on the patient's cognitive difficulties, motivational goals and his/her progress in competence level.

The use of errorless learning principles, scaffolding and attentional externalisation aims at improving the patients' performance on cognitive and everyday tasks by learning to apply compensation techniques as well as limiting dysfunctional uses of available cognitive ressources (i.e. excessive self-focus, rumination).

The study will provide MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery results from a relatively large Danish sample of first-episode schizophrenia and contribute with valuable normative data on the UPSA.

It is hypothesized that cognitive training integrated in OPUS treatment enhances both cognitive and everyday competence of patients more than OPUS treatment alone. Expectations are that cognitive training will demonstrate a small to moderate effect on cognitive functioning and a moderate effect on everyday functioning as measured with the UPSA. Moreover, patients allocated to cognitive training are expected to show an improvement in self-esteem.",Schizophrenia,Behavioral,Cognitive training

This inhibits normal movement and causes abnormalities in posture, stiffness and at times joint contractures. In this pilot study we hope to assess the ability for the direct current of Neubie, which creates mechanoreceptor inputs and lengthening at the sarcomere level of muscle and joints in the spine and lower extremity, to alter the proprioceptive peripheral nervous system (PNS) at muscle spindle and GTO level with a change in CNS over-guarding during the treatment and after the treatment. If the investigators are able to create normalized stretch and muscle tension at the PNS level, it may be possible to create temporary or sustained CNS level changes. This would allow the amount of stretch and tension at the PNS level to be normalized and possibly reduce spasticity. If this theory is accurate, the investigators may be able to increase access to normalized movement, strength and functional ability in individuals with neuro-compromise.",Multiple Sclerosis,Device,Neubie

Therefore, it would be interesting to suggest other treatment modalities with moderate coronary and/or minimally symptomatic OSA syndrome.",Acute Coronary Syndrome,Other,Control
