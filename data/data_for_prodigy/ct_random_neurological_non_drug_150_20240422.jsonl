So far, the mechanisms of the impact of these changes on the brain subcortical and cortical regions functioning, motor activities and cognitive functions are still not clear. The aim of this longitudinal human experiment is to examine the effects of cycle of 8-week high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on: (i) neurophysiological function of cortical motor structures and skeletal muscle actvity, (ii) psychomotor behavior critically associated with dopamine dependent neural structures functioning and (iii) neurotrophic factors' secretion level in blood. The investigators will recruit 40 PD individuals, who will be divided into two groups: one of them will perform two 8-weeks cycle of HIIT (PD-TR), and the other will not (PD-NTR). The investigators will recruit also 20 age-matched healthy controls (H-CO) as additional control group who will not perform the HIIT. All PD subjects will be examined during their medication \"OFF-phase\" pre HIIT and 1 week-, 1 month-POST cycle of HIIT. The subject from H-CO will be tested only once. To examine the assumed HIIT-induced changes in brain functioning the investigators will use: (i) EEG (recorded simultaneously with EMG) methods to assess an amplitude, location and directionality of brain electrical current of cortical regions and strength of intra-cortical network interactions during motor tasks performance. During the EEG experiments the subjects will perform (i) bimanual anti-phase DA level dependent motor tasks (during which the investigators will record EMG, force). The investigators will also assess motor and non-motor symptoms of PD and functional test of manual dexterity to evaluate a quality psychomotor behavior.\n\nUsing these methods the investigators will determine in detail the mechanisms of functioning of the CNS in PD patients, with emphasis on the cortical interactions that are dependent on synthesis and DA transmission. The results of the study will help to answer the fundamental questions about HIIT induced neuroplasticity in PD patients, as well as complement the lack in knowledge about the mechanisms of exercise-induced changes in PD, and as a consequence it could enrich the golden standard of treatment in PD from pharmacotherapy toward implementation of precise evidence based rehabilitation."}

Several studies have shown that patients with PD exhibit slowness because they are unable to modulate, in an optimal way, the velocity of voluntary motor acts not induced by external stimulation. Indeed, these patients have difficulties to integrate multi-sensorial information, mainly proprioception.\n\nThe investigators investigated changes in shoulder velocity during pointing movements by patients with PD after stimulation of soft tissues (aponeurosis) of upper limb muscles. The stimulation consisted of manipulating, with a hook (the diacutaneous fibrolysis method), the aponeurotic tissues enrobing the heads of the upper limb muscles. This technique has previously been shown to decrease passive tension and the tendon reflex response of the manipulated muscle group. The investigators hypothesis is that aponeurotic manipulation of shoulder muscles therefore creates a modification in the proprioceptive information, which in return temporarily decreases the bradykinesia of shoulder movements."}

Drug therapy for FMS is largely symptomatic as there is not yet a complete understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease. In the past 17 years, supervised aerobic exercise has emerged as an important treatment modality to improve pain, aerobic capacity, function, and well-being. Individuals who are able to adhere to exercise almost always maintain the symptomatic benefits of exercise. Unfortunately, the rate of exercise adherence six months after the completion of a well-structured supervised exercise program is disappointingly low. Furthermore, although the efficacy of supervised aerobic exercise in the research setting is well documented, the applicability of such intervention in the clinic setting is doubtful. Therefore, we propose to conduct the Research to Encourage Exercise for Fibromyalgia (REEF), a randomized attention-controlled trial whose primary aim is to evaluate the efficacy of telephone-delivered motivational interviewing (MI) to encourage exercise, in improving exercise adherence and self-report physical function (co-primary outcome measures) for FMS patients. REEF will enroll 200 FMS patients, randomizing them to either the MI group or the attention-control (AC) group. Participants from each group will receive a total of 6 telephone calls within a 12-week period. Prior to the phone calls, participants from both groups will receive an individualized exercise prescription and 2 supervised exercise training sessions to get them started on an exercise program. All subjects will undergo comprehensive outcome assessment at baseline, week 12, week 24, and week 36. The secondary aim of this proposal is to determine the mediators between MI and improvement in self-report physical function. The proposed research is significant because our focus is the promotion of adherence to an exercise program, of adequate intensity, in order to maximize functioning and well-being for patients with FMS. The use of a predominantly home-based exercise program and telephone-delivered MI by a trained licensed practice nurse (LPN) could potentially make the proposed intervention more accessible to the greater majority of FMS patients. Furthermore, if proven efficacious, MI could readily be applied to other chronically painful conditions (e.g. chronic back pain)."}

CSVD occurs six to ten times more often that an acute stroke. It is misleading to think, however, that CSVD is an inevitable part of \"getting old\" because people with CSVD are at high risk of developing an acute stroke or dementia. In fact, people with more CSVD lesion volume are more likely to develop day to day problems in planning, decision-making and speed of thinking. Unfortunately, there are no proven therapies designed to address CSVD. We propose to test whether aerobic exercise is an intervention that can combat CSVD because the disease is fundamentally a blood flow problem that may be improved by aerobic exercise. We will recruit CSVD adults with moderate to severe lesion burden and use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to study the brain in terms of structure, perfusion and function. Participants will be randomly assigned to either our established aerobic exercise program or a control stretching program. Both groups will take part in lab exercise sessions, which are designed to monitor progress and assess adherence to the program. The duration and intensity of their exercise will increase as participants progress. We will use activity log books, phone calls and extra \"booster\" exercise sessions, as needed, to maximize retention and adherence. We aim to show that aerobic exercise increases cerebral blood flow (CBF) in frontal-subcortical grey matter, supports regional tissue growth, and improves cognitive function in CSVD adults with substantial risk of acute stroke and dementia.

Of those who are affected by stroke, a third becomes permanently disabled. Risk factors for stroke include, but are not limited to, advancing age, physical inactivity, arterial stiffness, and most commonly, high blood pressure. Stroke is a major form of a much boarder problem, cardiovascular disease (CVD). CVD is considered the primary cause of death in the US. Interestingly, increased arterial stiffness of elastic arteries (carotid and aorta) has been shown to be strongly correlated to CVD and stroke. Increased arterial stiffness is considered an independent risk for the development of CVD and stroke. Hence, arterial stiffness has been suggested as a potential therapeutic target for CVD and more specifically stroke.\n\nRecently, whole-body vibration (WBV) exercise has been proposed as a new and effective method to improve muscle mass and muscle strength in younger and older individuals. It is known that systemic arterial stiffness decreased 40 min after a single WBV session in healthy men. In our laboratory, we have shown that leg arterial stiffness decreases after a session of WBV. Taken together, this data seems to suggest WBV may be used as a viable way to decrease arterial stiffness. Special populations, such as post-stroke patients, may be unwilling or unable to perform WBV exercise so an inactive form of exercise (vibration) therapy is needed.\n\nPassive vibration (PV), allows patients to lie in an inactive, supine position, with their legs placed onto the vibration plate. This exposes the lower limbs to continuous vibration without performing voluntary muscle contraction. PV has been shown to increase skin blood flow on the vibrated extremity through vasodilation in healthy individuals and type 2 diabetics. Previous work in our laboratory has demonstrated that a 10-min session of PV on the legs decreases augmentation index (AIx) , a marker of pressure wave reflection, as well as leg and systemic PWV through decreases in local peripheral resistance in young men. However, the effects of PV on arterial function in post-stroke patients are unknown.\n\nIt is hypothesized that post-stroke patients will demonstrate a decrease in leg PWV and central AIx. However, greater responses are expected with the lower vibration frequency."}

Professional caregivers of two nursing homes, one located in Italy and one in the Netherlands, will receive a specific training in SDM principles and will guide the SDM interview within the triad.

The AMEND Sub-study | Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), central sleep apnea (CSA) and heart failure (HF) are states of metabolic demand and sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activation. In patients with sleep apnea and HF, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) initially may reduce left ventricular (LV)stroke volume (SV) but subsequently improves and LV function. This may relate to an early beneficial effect on myocardial energetics through early reduction in metabolic demand that subsequently leads to improved efficiency of LV contraction. However, it is not clear whether long-term adaptive servo-ventilation (ASV) favorably affects cardiac energetics. Any such benefit may also relate to reduced sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activation. However its effect on myocardial SNS function is also not well studied.\n\nIn a pilot study we demonstrated early (6 week) beneficial effects of CPAP in patients with OSA and HF. The current proposal (AMEND) is a unique substudy of the recently funded ADVENT-HF trial (Adaptive Servo Ventilation for Therapy of Sleep Apnea in HeartFailure) (NCT01128816; CIHR; D. Bradley, PI).\n\nWe propose to evaluate the long-term (6 month) effects of ASV on daytime 1) oxidative metabolism; 2) the work metabolic index (WMI) as an estimate of mechanical efficiency; 3) myocardial sympathetic nerve (SN) pre-synaptic function; and 4) heart rate (HR) variability in patients with HF and coexisting OSA or CSA. In conjunction with echocardiographic measures of LV stroke work, positron emission tomography (PET) derived [11C] acetate kinetics will be used as a measure of oxidative metabolism, to determine the WMI. [11C] hydroxyephedrine (HED) retention will be used to measure cardiac SN pre-synaptic function.\n\nPrimary Hypotheses: In patients with chronic stable HF and CSA or OSA without excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), long-term (6-month) ASV therapy yields:\n\nBeneficial effects on daytime myocardial metabolism leading to a reduction in the rate of oxidative metabolism as measured by [11C]acetate kinetics using PET imaging;\nImprovement in energy transduction from oxidative metabolism to stroke work as measured by an increase in the daytime work-metabolic index."}

The temporal lobe has long been established as a region of interest in the speech perception and processing literature because it contains the auditory cortex. More recently, research has localized the supratemporal plane as an area that exhibits response specificity to acoustic properties of complex auditory signals like speech. The supratemporal plane, comprised of Heschl's gyrus, the planum polare, and the planum temporale, is capable of the rapid spectrotemporal analysis required to map acoustic information to linguistic representation. Neural activity in this area, however, is rarely studied directly because it is difficult to access with non-invasive measures like scalp electroencephalography (EEG). Capitalizing on the unique opportunity to access these areas via routine clinical stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) in a patient population, this study seeks to understand how cortical responses reflect the diagnosticity of two acoustic-phonetic dimensions of interest and how responses rapidly and flexibly adapt to changes in listening demands. Examining how neural response to voice onset time (VOT) and fundamental frequency (F0) modulates as a function of perceptual weight carried in signaling phoneme categories, and identifying how changes in listening context shift perceptual weight, will provide invaluable data that indicates how speech processing flexibly adapts to short-term acoustic patterns."}

{"nct_id": "NCT05148247", "source": "OfficialTitle+BriefSummary", "text": "Evaluation of The Perceive, Recall, Plan and Perform Intervention for Persons With Cognitive Impairments After Brain Injuries in Community Rehabilitation: Single Case Experimental Study | Background: There is a need for standardized interventions in community rehabilitation that can improve everyday task performance for older adults with cognitive challenges after acquired brain injury. Older adults are often excluded from research due to strict inclusion criteria. It is critical for a sustainable health service system that these patients are empowered and reach their maximum level of independence. The Perceive, Recall, Plan and Perform System (PRPP) of Intervention can be applied by Occupational Therapists (OT) for clients with cognitive challenges to enhance mastery of needed or desired everyday tasks. There is no current evidence for the effectiveness of this intervention for this population.\n\nPurpose: A clinical trial to investigate the effectiveness of the PRPP intervention for older persons with cognitive impairments after brain injury in the context of community-based rehabilitation.\n\nMethod: In PRPP intervention the OT uses systematically instructions in task training to support a client to use cognitive strategies efficiently. The everyday tasks used for training should be valued by the participant and useful in their rehabilitation. The tasks could include different parts of morning routines, simple or complex meal planning or preparation, use of cell phone, leisure activities, or other household and community activities. At best the skills are generalized throughout all everyday activities, and the OTs' role as a cognitive mediator fades as participants internalize the strategies. The participants receive PRPP intervention 3 times a week for 3 weeks, every session last for 45-60 minutes.\n\nThe participants' task mastery and cognitive strategy use will be measured at least 5 times in each phase: baseline, intervention, after the intervention, and 4 weeks after the discharge from rehabilitation. The measurement scores at baseline act controls and are therefore compared with the other phases for the same participant. The same procedure will be repeated for the other participants, but then with a staggered intervention phase. A staggered intervention phase acts as a control between participants and allows to see if changes occur only when the intervention is introduced.\n\nImplications for practice: The investigators assume that this systematic intervention will improve everyday task performance, and will in turn contribute to empowerment and independence of older adults with cognitive challenges after brain injuries."}

A Pilot Study. | Is Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) feasible and acceptable for adults with severe Traumatic Brain Injury (sTBI) in inpatient services? sTBI is associated with depression, anxiety and low self awareness. A key factor in recovery is adjustment to the effects of injury. Psychological intervention may facilitate this change\u037e however what works is unclear.

One major modality for BCI control is based on motor imagery (MI), which is the mental rehearsal of the kinesthetics of a movement without actually performing it. MI-based BCIs translate motor intents into control commands for external devices. A major challenge in such BCIs is differentiating MI patterns corresponding to fine hand movements of the same limb from non-invasive EEG recordings with low spatial resolution since the cortical sources responsible for these movements are overlapping. In this study, the investigators hypothesize that neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) applied contingent to the voluntary activation of the primary motor cortex through MI can help differentiate patterns of activity associated with different hand movements of the same limb by consistently recruiting the separate neural pathways associated with each of the movements within a closed-loop BCI setup. This is expected to be associated with neuroplastic changes at the cortical or corticospinal levels."}
