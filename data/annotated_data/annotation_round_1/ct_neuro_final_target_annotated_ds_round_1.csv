3,NCT03973203,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"The Effect of Niacin Supplementation on Systemic Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD+) Metabolism, Physiology and Muscle Performance in Healthy Controls and Mitochondrial Myopathy Patients | The most frequent form of adult-onset mitochondrial disorders is mitochondrial myopathy, often manifesting with progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO), progressive muscle weakness and exercise intolerance. Mitochondrial myopathy is often caused by single heteroplasmic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions or multiple mtDNA deletions, the former being sporadic and latter caused by mutations in nuclear-encoded proteins of mtDNA maintenance. Currently, no curative treatment exists for this disease. The investigators have previously observed that supplementation with an NAD+ precursor vitamin B3, nicotinamide riboside, prevented and delayed disease symptoms by increasing mitochondrial biogenesis in a mouse model for mitochondrial myopathy. Vitamin B3 exists in several forms: nicotinic acid (niacin), nicotinamide, and nicotinamide riboside, and it has been demonstrated to give power to diseased mitochondria in animal studies by increasing intracellular levels of NAD+, the important cofactor required for the cellular energy metabolism.

In this study, the form of vitamin B3, niacin, was used to activate dysfunctional mitochondria and to rescue signs of mitochondrial myopathy. Of the vitamin B3 forms, niacin, is employed, because it has been used in large doses to treat hypercholesterolemia patients, and has a proven safety record in humans. Phenotypically similar mitochondrial myopathy patients are studied, as the investigator's previous expertise indicates that similar presenting phenotypes predict uniform physiological and clinical responses to interventions, despite varying genetic backgrounds. Patients either with sporadic single mtDNA deletions or a mutation in a Twinkle gene causing multiple mtDNA deletions were recruited. In addition, for every patient, two gender- and age-matched healthy controls are recruited. Clinical examinations and collection of muscle biopsies are performed at the time points 0, 4 and 10 months (patients) or at 0 and 4 months (controls). Fasting blood samples are collected every second week until 4 months and thereafter every six weeks until the end of the study. The effects of niacin on disease markers, muscle mitochondrial biogenesis, muscle strength and the metabolism of the whole body are studied in patients and healthy controls.

The hypothesis is that an NAD+ precursor, niacin, will increase intracellular NAD+ levels, improve mitochondrial biogenesis and alleviate the symptoms of mitochondrial myopathy in humans.","[(14, 20, 'DRUG', 'Niacin'), (160, 182, 'CONDITION', 'Mitochondrial Myopathy'), (259, 281, 'CONDITION', 'mitochondrial myopathy'), (404, 426, 'CONDITION', 'Mitochondrial myopathy'), (918, 940, 'CONDITION', 'mitochondrial myopathy'), (978, 992, 'DRUG', 'nicotinic acid'), (994, 1000, 'DRUG', 'niacin'), (1282, 1288, 'DRUG', 'niacin'), (1361, 1383, 'CONDITION', 'mitochondrial myopathy'), (1410, 1416, 'DRUG', 'niacin'), (1576, 1598, 'CONDITION', 'mitochondrial myopathy'), (2336, 2342, 'DRUG', 'niacin'), (2538, 2544, 'DRUG', 'niacin'), (2650, 2672, 'CONDITION', 'mitochondrial myopathy')]","[(14, 20), (160, 182), (259, 281), (404, 426), (918, 940), (978, 992), (994, 1000), (1282, 1288), (1361, 1383), (1410, 1416), (1576, 1598), (2336, 2342), (2538, 2544), (2650, 2672)]","[(160, 182, 'CONDITION'), (259, 281, 'CONDITION'), (404, 426, 'CONDITION'), (918, 940, 'CONDITION'), (1361, 1383, 'CONDITION'), (1576, 1598, 'CONDITION'), (2650, 2672, 'CONDITION')]","[(14, 20, 'DRUG'), (978, 992, 'DRUG'), (994, 1000, 'DRUG'), (1282, 1288, 'DRUG'), (1410, 1416, 'DRUG'), (2336, 2342, 'DRUG'), (2538, 2544, 'DRUG')]"
4,NCT00423943,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"Modafinil for Treatment of Cognitive Dysfunction in Schizophrenia | Patients with schizophrenia have problems in thinking, known as cognitive dysfunction. This appears to be responsible for their difficulties in social and occupational functioning. One particular cognitive function that may be important for schizophrenia is called context processing. This refers to the ability to properly use information in the environment to guide thinking and behavior so that it is appropriate to the present circumstance. Problems with this function may explain why patients with schizophrenia think and act in unusual ways, and often have problems managing aspects of their lives that healthy adults take for granted. This cognitive function depends on a region of the brain called the prefrontal cortex, which shows impaired function in schizophrenia as well. Unfortunately, the biochemical aspects of this dysfunction are presently unknown, and it is not clear whether current psychiatric medications can improve this function. A recent FDA-approved medication that may improve this function is modafinil. Studies in animals and healthy adults show that this medication can improve cognitive functions which are related to context processing. We plan to study the effects of modafinil on context processing and the brain activity that underlies this function. We will use functional MRI and electrophysiology to examine the effects of modafinil, both after a single dose and after sustained (4 week) treatment. We predict that when patients receive modafinil they will perform better on cognitive tests and have improved activity in the regions of the brain that are responsible for these cognitive processes.","[(0, 9, 'DRUG', 'Modafinil'), (27, 48, 'CONDITION', 'Cognitive Dysfunction'), (52, 65, 'CONDITION', 'Schizophrenia'), (82, 95, 'CONDITION', 'schizophrenia'), (132, 153, 'CONDITION', 'cognitive dysfunction'), (309, 322, 'CONDITION', 'schizophrenia'), (571, 584, 'CONDITION', 'schizophrenia'), (1089, 1098, 'DRUG', 'modafinil'), (1269, 1278, 'DRUG', 'modafinil'), (1429, 1438, 'DRUG', 'modafinil'), (1543, 1552, 'DRUG', 'modafinil')]","[(0, 9), (27, 48), (52, 65), (82, 95), (132, 153), (309, 322), (571, 584), (1089, 1098), (1269, 1278), (1429, 1438), (1543, 1552)]","[(27, 48, 'CONDITION'), (52, 65, 'CONDITION'), (82, 95, 'CONDITION'), (132, 153, 'CONDITION'), (309, 322, 'CONDITION'), (571, 584, 'CONDITION')]","[(0, 9, 'DRUG'), (1089, 1098, 'DRUG'), (1269, 1278, 'DRUG'), (1429, 1438, 'DRUG'), (1543, 1552, 'DRUG')]"

13,NCT03244527,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"Use of BCAA-rich Protein Supplements for Chronic Stroke Patients to Improve the Functional Performance | In the past few years, Branched Chain Amino Acid (BCAA) supplements have gradually used on different groups. From training athletes, maintaining functions of healthy elders to preventing disabilities of people that can't do intense exercises. BCAAs are now considered to be able to prevent muscle atrophy and strength loss, also possible to increase strength and muscle mass if combined with resistance exercises. Stroke patients have difficulties with moving, which led to multiple disabilities, are more likely to have sarcopenia and strength loss. Furthermore, reducing the will of moving or walking. Recently, studies showed that combined BCAAs with resistance exercises can effectively increase muscle mass, thus commonly used on training athletes.

Although aerobic exercises are proven to be more likely to improve walking ability of chronic stroke patients than traditional rehabilitation, BCAAs' effects are yet to be proven. Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore if BCAAs combined with moderate intensity exercises can prevent muscle atrophy, loss of strength and cardiopulmonary function.

This is a randomized control trial. Participants are randomly assigned to either experiment or control groups. Both group received aerobic exercise (30 min in a session, 3 days a week, and for 8 weeks). Experiment group received BCAA supplement immediately after the exercise while the control group receive sham product (vitamins).

Children who have speech sound disorders as preschoolers are at risk for the later emergence of dyslexia, a risk that often reveals itself in the form of poor phonological awareness skills during the preschool period. Traditional speech therapy methods focus on articulation accuracy and do not focus on the child's more abstract knowledge of the sound system of the language. The ultimate objective of this research program is to prevent reading disability in children who present with speech sounds disorders. The relative effectiveness of different interventions to help these children achieve age-appropriate phonological processing skills prior to school entry will be investigated.

The investigators hypothesize that early ART mediates more rapid clearance of C. neoformans from CSF, as manifested by a greater rate of decrease in C. neoformans colony forming units (CFUs) during the first 28 days after initiating antifungal treatment.

Secondary hypotheses are that recovery of pathogen specific cellular immunity directed at C. neoformans, as manifested by increases in the number and function of C. neoformans-specific peripheral blood mononuclear cells is associated with 1) ART and 2) pathogen clearance.

41,NCT04106154,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"Impacting Children's Physical and Mental Health Through Kinesiology Support in Clinical Care | Over the past four decades, it has become clear that childhood physical activity carries with it a myriad of beneficial effects. It is closely linked to quality of life and the recognized benefits include, but are not limited to, optimal growth and development, a healthier self-concept, enhanced peer socialization, and decreased anxiety and depression. Long term, an active lifestyle decreases the risk of many important physical and mental morbidities. Thus, the observation that children living with medical conditions and disabilities (MC&D) today, although surviving longer thanks to advances in medical care, are much less active than their peers is a matter of significant concern. Research indicates that the 350,000 Ontario children with MC&D have lower levels of physical activity, higher screen time and more frequent sleep problems.

While the reasons underlying this reality are complex, previous research has identified a substantial subset of children who are motivated to be active but lack the confidence to do so. Fear of pain, concern for MC&D exacerbation and a lack of confidence in individual physical movement capacity contribute to their hesitation. Clinical experience suggests that these children represent 50% to 70% of inactive patients. Research indicates that being motivated to make a change and having the confidence that the desired change can be achieved are the essential precursors upon which successful behaviour change initiatives are built.

46,NCT04610879,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"Randomised Factorial Design Controlled Trial Comparing Carbamazepine, Levetiracetam or Active Monitoring Combined With or Without Sleep Behaviour Intervention in Treatment Naive Children With Rolandic Epilepsy | Rolandic epilepsy (RE) is the most common type of epilepsy. Children with RE have seizures and can often find that their learning, sleep, behaviour, self-esteem and mood are affected.

As part of standard NHS care, children diagnosed with RE may be treated with standard anti-epileptic medicines, like carbamazepine, or no medicine at all. The medicines used to treat epilepsy often slow down a child's thinking and learning. In the past, doctors believed this was an acceptable price to pay to reduce seizures. However, with RE, where the seizures usually stop in teenage years, investigators do not know if it is better to treat these children with medicines or not, especially if the medicines might have a negative effect on their learning.

A newer medicine called levetiracetam has also been found to work in children with RE and has shown less problems with thinking and learning in adults. However, it is still no known if this is also the case for children and it has not been proven which of the three options (carbamazepine, levetiracetam or no treatment) would be best for RE patients. The CASTLE study aims to find this out.

In addition, it has been found that seizures often happen when a child has had poor sleep and they often come at night or early in the morning. It has been shown that sleep can be improved through practice without the need of medicines. There are established guidelines to help toddlers go to sleep, but nothing available that helps young people with epilepsy and their parents improve their sleep quality. In the CASTLE study, a sleep training plan has been developed for children with epilepsy and the trial aims to find out whether following this sleep training plan results in less seizures than using no sleep training at all.","[(55, 68, 'DRUG', 'Carbamazepine'), (70, 83, 'DRUG', 'Levetiracetam'), (130, 158, 'BEHAVIOURAL', 'Sleep Behaviour Intervention'), (192, 209, 'CONDITION', 'Rolandic Epilepsy'), (212, 229, 'CONDITION', 'Rolandic epilepsy'), (231, 233, 'CONDITION', 'RE'), (262, 270, 'CONDITION', 'epilepsy'), (286, 288, 'CONDITION', 'RE'), (294, 302, 'CONDITION', 'seizures'), (451, 453, 'CONDITION', 'RE'), (514, 527, 'DRUG', 'carbamazepine'), (580, 588, 'CONDITION', 'epilepsy'), (714, 722, 'CONDITION', 'seizures'), (738, 740, 'CONDITION', 'RE'), (752, 760, 'CONDITION', 'seizures'), (982, 995, 'DRUG', 'levetiracetam'), (1041, 1043, 'CONDITION', 'RE'), (1233, 1246, 'DRUG', 'carbamazepine'), (1248, 1261, 'DRUG', 'levetiracetam'), (1265, 1277, 'CONTROL', 'no treatment'), (1297, 1299, 'CONDITION', 'RE'), (1387, 1395, 'CONDITION', 'seizures'), (1702, 1710, 'CONDITION', 'epilepsy'), (1781, 1795, 'BEHAVIOURAL', 'sleep training'), (1838, 1846, 'CONDITION', 'epilepsy'), (1901, 1915, 'BEHAVIOURAL', 'sleep training'), (1937, 1945, 'CONDITION', 'seizures'), (1957, 1974, 'CONTROL', 'no sleep training')]","[(55, 68), (70, 83), (130, 158), (192, 209), (212, 229), (231, 233), (262, 270), (286, 288), (294, 302), (451, 453), (514, 527), (580, 588), (714, 722), (738, 740), (752, 760), (982, 995), (1041, 1043), (1233, 1246), (1248, 1261), (1265, 1277), (1297, 1299), (1387, 1395), (1702, 1710), (1781, 1795), (1838, 1846), (1901, 1915), (1937, 1945), (1957, 1974)]","[(192, 209, 'CONDITION'), (212, 229, 'CONDITION'), (231, 233, 'CONDITION'), (262, 270, 'CONDITION'), (286, 288, 'CONDITION'), (294, 302, 'CONDITION'), (451, 453, 'CONDITION'), (580, 588, 'CONDITION'), (714, 722, 'CONDITION'), (738, 740, 'CONDITION'), (752, 760, 'CONDITION'), (1041, 1043, 'CONDITION'), (1297, 1299, 'CONDITION'), (1387, 1395, 'CONDITION'), (1702, 1710, 'CONDITION'), (1838, 1846, 'CONDITION'), (1937, 1945, 'CONDITION')]","[(55, 68, 'DRUG'), (70, 83, 'DRUG'), (130, 158, 'BEHAVIOURAL'), (514, 527, 'DRUG'), (982, 995, 'DRUG'), (1233, 1246, 'DRUG'), (1248, 1261, 'DRUG'), (1265, 1277, 'CONTROL'), (1781, 1795, 'BEHAVIOURAL'), (1901, 1915, 'BEHAVIOURAL'), (1957, 1974, 'CONTROL')]"

This project also seeks to evaluate the effect of methylphenidate on postural control in these patients, a debilitating motor symptom that places patients at an increased risk of falling. This study will build on existing data to support a new indication for the use of methylphenidate in Parkinson's Disease. Using standard and objective evaluations, this study will quantify the effect of methylphenidate at two doses on attention levels, orthostatic hypotension, and measures of postural control. Phase I of the study will compare methylphenidate 10mg three times daily to placebo and Phase II of the study, for those tolerating the lower dose in Phase I, will compare methylphenidate 20mg three times daily to placebo. By incorporating two different doses, the study also seeks to determine if any improvements are dose-related. Secondary endpoints will include safety assessments (adverse event monitoring and vital signs) performed every 30 minutes following supervised drug administration. Visual analog scales will be presented to each participant before treatment and following the final dose of each treatment to assess changes in fatigue. A secondary task will be added to postural tests to assess the influence of cognitive processes. It is hypothesized that methylphenidate will demonstrate a significant beneficial effect on all outcomes. It is projected that objective improvements will be observed following treatment with methylphenidate at both doses (10 and 20mg three time daily) when compared to placebo.

55,NCT05025917,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"Assessing the Effect of Shatavari Supplementation on Bone and Skeletal Muscle Health in Healthy Postmenopausal Women: A Randomised Double Blind Clinical Trial | Shatavari is a plant that grows in Nepal, Sri Lanka, India and the Himalayas and its root has long been used in Ayurvedic medicine. Its traditional uses include supporting women's health, particularly during breastfeeding and during the perimenopausal period. Shatavari has been found to contain substances that have similar chemical properties to estrogen. A decrease in the amount of ovarian estrogen production causes the menopause and this reduction in circulating estrogen has widespread effects, including promoting a decrease in bone density. This increases the risk of bone fractures. Having less oestrogen is also thought to contribute to a loss of muscle strength in postmenopausal women.

As shatavari may act on the body's tissues in a similar way to estrogen, shatavari supplementation may represent one way of preventing postmenopausal bone and muscle loss. This study will investigate these questions. 24 healthy postmenopausal women aged 60 years or older will be recruited. The participants will be randomly assigned to consume shatavari (1000 mg per day, equivalent to 26,500 mg per day fresh weight shatavari) or placebo (1000 mg per day magnesium stearate) for 6 weeks.

Recent developments in neuroimaging have focus on the reasons why some patients recover well while some do poorly. However, there is still no consensus on the exact mechanisms involved in regaining the functions after rehabilitation. Application of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to facilitate neural plasticity during stroke treatment has recently gained considerable attention. The possible mechanism through which rTMS acts is based on the interhemispheric competition (IHC) model, which explains that patients with stroke experience alterations in cortical excitability and exhibit abnormally high interhemispheric inhibition from the unaffected hemisphere to the affected hemisphere. The visual feedback training can improve postural control and enhance motor performance. Several rTMS studies have evaluated the lower extremity dysfunction following stroke, but few studies have explored the efficacy of applying rTMS on the lower extremities. We expect the study can help us to further exploration of the change of clinical function and cortical excitability following rTMS and visual feedback training in subjects with stroke.

Of those about 30% have hemiplegic cerebral palsy (HPC),a unilateral impairment, which can often lead to major difficulties with manual dexterity and upper limb,functional ability and independence. Therapists employ a number of strategies in upper limb rehabilitation however they are poorly understood and their efficacy has been questioned. Constraint induced movement therapy (CIMT)has been found to be an effective intervention with HCP however its use in the preschool child within a national health service (NHS) setting has not been evaluated. The investigators aim is to compare CIMT using prolonged restraint with CIMT using brief manual restraint which may be standard practice and acts as the control. This age group has been targeted as there may be greatest neural plasticity (change)and minimal disruption to compulsory education. The investigators intend to recruit 60 patients from treatment databases of participating trusts. Patients will be randomised following baseline assessments which will include 2 upper limb assessments(The Assisting Hand Assessment and the Quality of Upper Extremity Skills Test) and a quality of life questionnaire (PedsQL Generic Core Scales and the Cerebral Palsy Module) for parents. The intervention period will be for 6 weeks offered intermittently (2week blocks) over 10 weeks. Parents /guardians and possibly preschool workers will be expected to carry out a therapy guided programme. The amount of intervention and compliance will be recorded by parents/guardians and therapists. Assessments will be repeated at 10 weeks and 24 weeks from the beginning of the trial. The results of the trial will contribute to the evidence on the effectiveness of CIMT in the preschool child with HCP, and will also provide evidence on the implementation of CIMT delivery within the current NHS therapy services.

Impact of Animal-assisted Therapy on the Well-being in Patients With Alzheimer's Disease | The animal-assisted therapy (AAT) is now considered a non-drug care and is often used in geriatrics. Many studies have shown a link between the presence of the animal and the psycho-behavioral symptoms decrease in dementia (PBSD) such as depression, anxiety or irritability that affects their quality of life and improved cognitive abilities. However, many methodological flaws in these researches exist.

The aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of AAT on the well-being of patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) at the stage of Major Neuro Cognitive Disorder (NCD) at short and medium term (before care, during care (at the beginning and end of each session), 1 week after, 2 weeks and 1 month after the last session) compared to a group receiving the same stimulation without the dog's response.

Patients will be seen in groups of 4 to 6 people at 8 workshops. 2 groups will be formed: AAT group versus control group. The only difference between these two groups is the intervention of the dog at each workshop in the AAT group.

Each workshop will consist of three identical times. It will begin with a 15 minute introductory activity, the first goal will be to establish a relationship with patients (patients-patients and patients-caregivers) and a 40 minute cognitive stimulation, identical in the 2 groups, will be proposed and finally 5 minutes will be devoted to the closing of the session This study should highlight a positive effect of animal assisted therapy on the well-being, PBSD, depression, anxiety and cognitive abilities and a long-term retention of these positive effects.","[(18, 37, 'OTHER', 'Animal Intervention'), (65, 88, 'OTHER', 'Animal-assisted Therapy'), (124, 143, 'CONDITION', ""Alzheimer's Disease""), (150, 173, 'OTHER', 'animal-assisted therapy'), (175, 178, 'OTHER', 'AAT'), (290, 312, 'OTHER', 'presence of the animal'), (360, 368, 'CONDITION', 'dementia'), (384, 394, 'CONDITION', 'depression'), (396, 403, 'CONDITION', 'anxiety'), (609, 612, 'OTHER', 'AAT'), (648, 665, 'CONDITION', 'Alzheimer disease'), (667, 669, 'CONDITION', 'AD'), (687, 717, 'CONDITION', 'Major Neuro Cognitive Disorder'), (719, 722, 'CONDITION', 'NCD'), (911, 954, 'CONTROL', ""same stimulation without the dog's response""), (1011, 1020, 'OTHER', 'workshops'), (1047, 1050, 'OTHER', 'AAT'), (1131, 1154, 'OTHER', 'intervention of the dog'), (1179, 1182, 'OTHER', 'AAT'), (1423, 1444, 'OTHER', 'cognitive stimulation'), (1607, 1630, 'OTHER', 'animal assisted therapy'), (1656, 1666, 'CONDITION', 'depression'), (1668, 1675, 'CONDITION', 'anxiety')]","[(18, 37), (65, 88), (124, 143), (150, 173), (175, 178), (290, 312), (360, 368), (384, 394), (396, 403), (609, 612), (648, 665), (667, 669), (687, 717), (719, 722), (911, 954), (1011, 1020), (1047, 1050), (1131, 1154), (1179, 1182), (1423, 1444), (1607, 1630), (1656, 1666), (1668, 1675)]","[(124, 143, 'CONDITION'), (360, 368, 'CONDITION'), (384, 394, 'CONDITION'), (396, 403, 'CONDITION'), (648, 665, 'CONDITION'), (667, 669, 'CONDITION'), (687, 717, 'CONDITION'), (719, 722, 'CONDITION'), (1656, 1666, 'CONDITION'), (1668, 1675, 'CONDITION')]","[(18, 37, 'OTHER'), (65, 88, 'OTHER'), (150, 173, 'OTHER'), (175, 178, 'OTHER'), (290, 312, 'OTHER'), (609, 612, 'OTHER'), (911, 954, 'CONTROL'), (1011, 1020, 'OTHER'), (1047, 1050, 'OTHER'), (1131, 1154, 'OTHER'), (1179, 1182, 'OTHER'), (1423, 1444, 'OTHER'), (1607, 1630, 'OTHER')]"

99,NCT00247533,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"The Early Diagnosis and Prevention of Ischemic Stroke and Cognition Decline Associated With Coronary Artery Disease Combined With Cerebral Artery Stenosis or Arrhythmia by 24-Hour Simultaneous Recorder of Electrocardiograph and Electroencephalography | There are many reports about the association of coronary artery disease (CAD) and cerebral artery stenosis (CAS), which had been proved to induce stroke and cognition decline after the revascularization including coronary bypass surgery (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention. Perfusion defect on nuclear brain scan is also noted to correlate with these neurological complications. On the other hand, the perioperative arrhythmia and following cerebral embolism was also attributed to be one factor inducing such neurological hazards.

In the patients with coexistent CAD and CAS (1st group), and also the patients scheduled for CABG or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (2nd group), we, the researchers at Far Eastern Memorial Hospital, attempted to integrate all the parameters mention above, including angiography of coronary and cerebral system, quantitative analysis of nuclear brain scan, biochemical profile, and signals of a new ambulatory device which could record the electrocardiograph (ECG) and electroencephalograph (EEG) simultaneously, in order to define the correlation between them. A chorological relation between EEG signals and ECG signals is our first target to be worked out. Thereafter, we hope to establish a regression model of all involved parameters according to the relation. Such a model, we believe, is essential not only to explain the post-CABG neurological complications, but to prevent them.

Furthermore, for the undetermined ischemic stroke patients who had no obvious culprit artery or embolism source, the paroxysmal arrhythmia had long been regarded as the cause. Whether a paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which had not been disclosed by routine ECG, could induce most of such a stroke is still not known. With this new ambulatory device which could record the electrocardiograph (ECG) and electroencephalograph (EEG) simultaneously, we want to answer the question.","[(24, 75, 'OTHER', 'Prevention of Ischemic Stroke and Cognition Decline'), (92, 115, 'CONDITION', 'Coronary Artery Disease'), (130, 154, 'CONDITION', 'Cerebral Artery Stenosis'), (158, 168, 'CONDITION', 'Arrhythmia'), (172, 250, 'OTHER', '24-Hour Simultaneous Recorder of Electrocardiograph and Electroencephalography'), (301, 324, 'CONDITION', 'coronary artery disease'), (326, 329, 'CONDITION', 'CAD'), (335, 359, 'CONDITION', 'cerebral artery stenosis'), (361, 364, 'CONDITION', 'CAS'), (399, 405, 'CONDITION', 'stroke'), (466, 489, 'CONDITION', 'coronary bypass surgery'), (491, 495, 'CONDITION', 'CABG'), (500, 534, 'CONDITION', 'percutaneous coronary intervention'), (664, 688, 'CONDITION', 'perioperative arrhythmia'), (703, 720, 'CONDITION', 'cerebral embolism'), (827, 830, 'CONDITION', 'CAD'), (835, 838, 'CONDITION', 'CAS'), (888, 892, 'CONDITION', 'CABG'), (896, 930, 'CONDITION', 'percutaneous coronary intervention'), (932, 935, 'CONDITION', 'PCI'), (1633, 1669, 'CONDITION', 'post-CABG neurological complications'), (1727, 1742, 'CONDITION', 'ischemic stroke'), (1810, 1831, 'CONDITION', 'paroxysmal arrhythmia'), (1879, 1909, 'CONDITION', 'paroxysmal atrial fibrillation'), (1984, 1990, 'CONDITION', 'stroke')]","[(24, 75), (92, 115), (130, 154), (158, 168), (172, 250), (301, 324), (326, 329), (335, 359), (361, 364), (399, 405), (466, 489), (491, 495), (500, 534), (664, 688), (703, 720), (827, 830), (835, 838), (888, 892), (896, 930), (932, 935), (1633, 1669), (1727, 1742), (1810, 1831), (1879, 1909), (1984, 1990)]","[(92, 115, 'CONDITION'), (130, 154, 'CONDITION'), (158, 168, 'CONDITION'), (301, 324, 'CONDITION'), (326, 329, 'CONDITION'), (335, 359, 'CONDITION'), (361, 364, 'CONDITION'), (399, 405, 'CONDITION'), (466, 489, 'CONDITION'), (491, 495, 'CONDITION'), (500, 534, 'CONDITION'), (664, 688, 'CONDITION'), (703, 720, 'CONDITION'), (827, 830, 'CONDITION'), (835, 838, 'CONDITION'), (888, 892, 'CONDITION'), (896, 930, 'CONDITION'), (932, 935, 'CONDITION'), (1633, 1669, 'CONDITION'), (1727, 1742, 'CONDITION'), (1810, 1831, 'CONDITION'), (1879, 1909, 'CONDITION'), (1984, 1990, 'CONDITION')]","[(24, 75, 'OTHER'), (172, 250, 'OTHER')]"

However, in patients the treatment may leave visible depressions of the scalp, just above the trepanation sites, that typically develop gradually after weeks - months after the procedure. A considerable proportion of patients find this aesthetically, functionally and psychologically disturbing; the skin depressions may even cause pain or interfere with activities of daily living, such as combing, etc.

An effective method would exist to avoid this undesired treatment effect: Before the skin is closed, a permeable titanium burr-hole plate could be attached above the trepanation site in order to prevent the skin from sinking into the bony defect. However, this is rarely done today, likely because there is no evidence that this treatment modification is effective and safe. Moreover, as material is implanted, this causes additional costs.

The primary aim of this study is to evaluate whether the application of burr-hole plates on both the frontal and parietal burr-hole in the context of burr-hole trepanation for the treatment of cSDH can improve patient satisfaction with the aesthetic result of the surgery.

In addition, the study is intended to demonstrate that this additional measure will not result in poorer hematoma control, poorer clinical/neurological outcomes, or additional complications for the patient.

In a prospective, single-blind and controlled approach, we randomize 80 patients with uni- or bilateral cSDH into an intervention group (with burr-hole plates) or into a control group (without burr-hole plates).

The primary end result of the study is the patient's reported satisfaction with the aesthetic outcome of the surgical scar. Secondary results are pain, functionality, neurological status, health-related quality of life, residual hematoma volume, and complications (according to Clavien-Dindo scale; especially re-operation rate for recurring cSDH and infections).

This protein-restricted diet is devoid of natural dietary sources of n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA), such as eggs, meat, milk or fish. Therefore, blood concentrations of n-3 LC-PUFA, especially of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are reduced in PKU children compared to healthy controls. DHA availability is considered important for optimal neurological function. Previous studies have shown that neural function of PKU children is improved by high dose supplementation of fish oil providing DHA, as shown by significant improvements of both visual evoked potential latencies and of fine motor skills and coordination, but no dose response relationship has been established so far.

This multicentric double-blind randomized trial aims at determining quantitative DHA requirements for optimal neural function in PKU children. Patients with classical PKU from several major treatment centers in Europe will be randomized to receive between 0 and 8 mg of DHA per kg body weight daily for a duration of 6 months. Biochemical (fatty acid composition of plasma phospholipids, lipoprotein metabolism and metabolic profiles), and functional testing (visual evoked potentials, fine motor skills, cognitive function and markers of immune function) will be performed at baseline and after 6 months. Intake per kg body weight will be related to outcome parameters and thus a possible dose response relationship will be defined. The results from this study are expected to contribute to the improvement of the diet of PKU patients, but they also have the potential to help defining quantitative DHA needs of healthy children.

Although there are currently few possibilities to prevent and/or slow the signs of cognitive decline, both those associated with age and neurodegenerative pathologies, one of the non-invasive brain stimulation techniques that has gained attention in recent years is Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS). tDCS is a technique based on the application of a low-intensity (< 2 mA) direct electrical current between two large-area electrodes placed on various surface areas of the head. Moreover, according to safety-related meta-analyses it is a very safe technique, without any major side effects, provided that internationally established safety protocols are taken into account in its application. This technique has recently been investigated as a potential treatment for both healthy elderly people and people with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease in several cognitive variables, having shown encouraging results in working memory learning curves, modulation of plasticity and recognition tasks. This project aims to implement an intervention using transcranial direct current stimulation in healthy older adults, MCI and AD. The main objective is to test if there is an improvement in cognitive efficiency and if the changes are maintained over time (1 month). For this purpose, the effect of the technique will be studied on participants assigned to treatment and control groups, analyzing the possible modifications in the following cognitive variables: cognitive plasticity and learning potential, recognition and familiarity and false alarms.","[(0, 52, 'OTHER', 'Non-invasive Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation'), (133, 163, 'CONDITION', 'decline in cognitive functions'), (189, 218, 'CONDITION', 'decline in cognitive function'), (361, 378, 'CONDITION', 'cognitive decline'), (457, 498, 'OTHER', 'non-invasive brain stimulation techniques'), (544, 583, 'OTHER', 'Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation'), (585, 589, 'OTHER', 'tDCS'), (592, 596, 'OTHER', 'tDCS'), (1104, 1129, 'CONDITION', 'mild cognitive impairment'), (1134, 1153, 'CONDITION', ""Alzheimer's disease""), (1355, 1394, 'OTHER', 'transcranial direct current stimulation'), (1420, 1423, 'CONDITION', 'MCI'), (1428, 1430, 'CONDITION', 'AD')]","[(0, 52), (133, 163), (189, 218), (361, 378), (457, 498), (544, 583), (585, 589), (592, 596), (1104, 1129), (1134, 1153), (1355, 1394), (1420, 1423), (1428, 1430)]","[(133, 163, 'CONDITION'), (189, 218, 'CONDITION'), (361, 378, 'CONDITION'), (1104, 1129, 'CONDITION'), (1134, 1153, 'CONDITION'), (1420, 1423, 'CONDITION'), (1428, 1430, 'CONDITION')]","[(0, 52, 'OTHER'), (457, 498, 'OTHER'), (544, 583, 'OTHER'), (585, 589, 'OTHER'), (592, 596, 'OTHER'), (1355, 1394, 'OTHER')]"

113,NCT02444065,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"Rapid Response to Day Hospital Treatment in Bulimia Nervosa and Purging Disorder: A Randomized Controlled Trial of an Intervention to Facilitate Early Symptom Change | Treatments for bulimia nervosa (BN) have relatively high rates of nonremission and relapse, meaning that improving treatments is a high priority in this area. Rapid response to treatment -cessation of binge eating and vomiting symptoms within the first weeks of treatment - is a robust predictor of improved post-treatment outcomes and lower relapse rates, but no study has tried to facilitate rapid response as a means of improving treatment outcomes. The present study responds to this gap in the literature by testing a 4-session CBT-based individual intervention for rapid response (i.e., ""CBT-RR""), designed to augment standard day hospital (DH) treatment for BN and Purging Disorder (PD) by focusing on strategies and skills for rapid symptom interruption. CBT-RR will be compared to a matched-intensity augmentative motivational interviewing (MI) intervention. Participants will be recruited from a hospital-based day program for eating disorders, and will be randomly assigned to one of the two conditions in addition to the DH as usual. participants will be assessed at pre-intervention, post-intervention, week 4 of DH, post-DH, and 6 months follow-up. It is hypothesized that compared to those who receive MI, patients who receive CBT-RR will be more likely to exhibit a rapid response to day hospital treatment (i.e., </= 3 binge eating and/or vomiting episodes in the first 4 weeks). It is further hypothesized that patients who receive CBT-RR will exhibit fewer binge eating and/or vomiting episodes at post-DH and at 6-month follow-up. Potential mediators and moderators of these hypothesized treatment effects will be examined on an exploratory basis, including self-efficacy, motivation, and hope (potential mediators), and emotion regulation, depression, cognitive psychopathology of eating disorders, and working alliance with the therapist (potential moderators).","[(0, 40, 'BEHAVIOURAL', 'Rapid Response to Day Hospital Treatment'), (44, 59, 'CONDITION', 'Bulimia Nervosa'), (64, 80, 'CONDITION', 'Purging Disorder'), (183, 198, 'CONDITION', 'bulimia nervosa'), (200, 202, 'CONDITION', 'BN'), (327, 365, 'BEHAVIOURAL', 'Rapid response to treatment -cessation'), (562, 576, 'BEHAVIOURAL', 'rapid response'), (701, 753, 'BEHAVIOURAL', 'CBT-based individual intervention for rapid response'), (762, 768, 'BEHAVIOURAL', 'CBT-RR'), (833, 835, 'CONDITION', 'BN'), (840, 856, 'CONDITION', 'Purging Disorder'), (858, 860, 'CONDITION', 'PD'), (931, 937, 'BEHAVIOURAL', 'CBT-RR'), (960, 1016, 'CONTROL', 'matched-intensity augmentative motivational interviewing'), (1018, 1020, 'CONTROL', 'MI'), (1105, 1121, 'CONDITION', 'eating disorders'), (1385, 1387, 'CONTROL', 'MI'), (1410, 1416, 'BEHAVIOURAL', 'CBT-RR'), (1618, 1624, 'BEHAVIOURAL', 'CBT-RR'), (1970, 1986, 'CONDITION', 'eating disorders')]","[(0, 40), (44, 59), (64, 80), (183, 198), (200, 202), (327, 365), (562, 576), (701, 753), (762, 768), (833, 835), (840, 856), (858, 860), (931, 937), (960, 1016), (1018, 1020), (1105, 1121), (1385, 1387), (1410, 1416), (1618, 1624), (1970, 1986)]","[(44, 59, 'CONDITION'), (64, 80, 'CONDITION'), (183, 198, 'CONDITION'), (200, 202, 'CONDITION'), (833, 835, 'CONDITION'), (840, 856, 'CONDITION'), (858, 860, 'CONDITION'), (1105, 1121, 'CONDITION'), (1970, 1986, 'CONDITION')]","[(0, 40, 'BEHAVIOURAL'), (327, 365, 'BEHAVIOURAL'), (562, 576, 'BEHAVIOURAL'), (701, 753, 'BEHAVIOURAL'), (762, 768, 'BEHAVIOURAL'), (931, 937, 'BEHAVIOURAL'), (960, 1016, 'CONTROL'), (1018, 1020, 'CONTROL'), (1385, 1387, 'CONTROL'), (1410, 1416, 'BEHAVIOURAL'), (1618, 1624, 'BEHAVIOURAL')]"

120,NCT05337982,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"Eccentric Motor Training With Neuromodulation and Biomarkers for Rehabilitation Readiness in Subacute SCI | The investigators are studying a new rehabilitation treatment for individuals trying to recover walking after spinal cord injury (SCI). The investigators will test conditions in the blood and spinal fluid to determine the best time to start this new training program. This will include checking for certain features called biomarkers by testing participants' spinal fluid and blood and compare these features to individuals without SCI. These features will help investigators determine when to start the new training program, either right away or waiting for 3 months. The new training program uses walking downhill on a slight slope on a treadmill while muscles that are not working normally are stimulated to contract using low levels of electricity. Adding this stimulation will allow people to practice walking and other skills even though full muscle control has not recovered. This new program will be in addition to any other rehabilitation therapy and will not replace standard rehabilitation. The hope is to see if downhill training with muscle stimulation, when delivered at the most ideal time, will improve trunk and leg movement, walking, and overall function. This recovery of movement and function will be compared to people with SCI receiving standard rehabilitation alone.

129,NCT02856035,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"Novel Brain Signal Feedback Paradigm to Enhance Motor Learning After Stroke | Stroke (795,000/year in the US and 30 million existing stroke survivors in the world) damages brain neural structures that control coordinated upper limb movement. To most effectively target the brain damage, interventions should be directed so as to restore brain control serving coordination of peripheral neuromuscular function. Currently, there is a lack of a transformative intervention strategy, and only limited efficacy is seen in response to neural rehabilitation that is only peripherally-directed (limbs e.g.) or only directed at the brain. This study will employ a novel neural feedback approach with a closed-loop, real-time paradigm to engage and retrain existing brain function after stroke. Real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMIR) provides neural feedback with the advantage of precisely identifying the location of brain activity for multiple cognitive and emotional tasks. However, the rtfMRI is costly and precludes motor learning that requires sitting and engaging the upper limb in complex motor tasks during imaging acquisition. In contrast, real-time functional near-infrared spectroscopy (rtfNIRS), although not as spatially precise as rtfMRI, offers a low-cost, portable solution to provide brain neural feedback during motor learning. This proposal will utilize both technologies in a hybrid, sequential motor learning protocol. Moreover, the study protocol will also simultaneously involve both central effective signals (through neural feedback) and peripheral affective signals by employing neutrally-triggered functional electrical stimulation (FES)-assisted coordination practice, which produces peripherally-induced affective signals from muscle and joint receptors. This novel combination intervention protocol will engage the central nervous system, motor effective pathway training along with induction of affective signal production (FES-assisted practice), all of which will be implemented within the framework of evidence-based motor learning principles.","[(6, 36, 'OTHER', 'Brain Signal Feedback Paradigm'), (69, 75, 'CONDITION', 'Stroke'), (78, 84, 'CONDITION', 'Stroke'), (133, 139, 'CONDITION', 'stroke'), (661, 724, 'OTHER', 'neural feedback approach with a closed-loop, real-time paradigm'), (777, 783, 'CONDITION', 'stroke'), (851, 866, 'OTHER', 'neural feedback'), (1317, 1332, 'OTHER', 'neural feedback'), (1406, 1448, 'OTHER', 'hybrid, sequential motor learning protocol'), (1552, 1567, 'OTHER', 'neural feedback'), (1615, 1705, 'OTHER', 'neutrally-triggered functional electrical stimulation (FES)-assisted coordination practice'), (1879, 1911, 'OTHER', 'motor effective pathway training'), (1965, 1986, 'OTHER', 'FES-assisted practice')]","[(6, 36), (69, 75), (78, 84), (133, 139), (661, 724), (777, 783), (851, 866), (1317, 1332), (1406, 1448), (1552, 1567), (1615, 1705), (1879, 1911), (1965, 1986)]","[(69, 75, 'CONDITION'), (78, 84, 'CONDITION'), (133, 139, 'CONDITION'), (777, 783, 'CONDITION')]","[(6, 36, 'OTHER'), (661, 724, 'OTHER'), (851, 866, 'OTHER'), (1317, 1332, 'OTHER'), (1406, 1448, 'OTHER'), (1552, 1567, 'OTHER'), (1615, 1705, 'OTHER'), (1879, 1911, 'OTHER'), (1965, 1986, 'OTHER')]"

Speech therapists use behavioural therapies (compensatory and rehabilitative) to alleviate such swallowing problems, with limited benefit. Compensatory strategies such as postural changes and changes in food consistency, have been found to be partially effective, especially in patients with mild dysphagia and may be ineffective in patients with more severe dysphagia. The rehabilitative strategies include ""no swallow exercises"" which aim to strengthen isolated muscles used in swallowing (such as tongue strengthening) and ""swallowing exercises"" that aim at strengthening all the muscles used in swallowing while executing a hard, effortful, or prolonged swallow. To date, no randomized clinical trials have shown that rehabilitative strategies are effective. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES), often referred to as electrical stimulation, was introduced as a novel therapy for dysphagia in the late 2001. The principles of NMES in the limb rehabilitation literature are well established. However published protocols applying NMES to swallowing function have shown mixed results in people with stroke and only one study was published on MS people. This will be a double blinded, randomized clinical trial (patients and research staff blinded) with two arms: standard speech therapy plus Active NMES vs speech therapy with Sham NMES.

Within the first year of injury, more than 50% of people discharged with a SCI may require re-hospitalization due to a secondary complication, such as a urinary tract infection, pressure ulcer or pneumonia. Even 20 years post-injury, re-hospitalization rates remain over 30%. While re-hospitalization rates in Canada have remained high for more than 10 years, the length of stay in inpatient rehabilitation has decreased dramatically, thereby limiting the time for provision of health information and skill acquisition in the inpatient rehabilitation setting. There is growing evidence from two recent pilot trials to suggest that self-management programs that provide appropriate health information, skills and telephone-based support for community-dwelling patients with SCI improves health behaviors and leads to reductions in re-hospitalization.

Goals/Research Aim: To conduct a pilot RCT (feasibility study) that will inform the design of a definitive RCT to determine whether an online self-management program incorporating trained peer health coaches (called ""SCI&U"") compared to usual care will result in improved self-management skills (short-term outcome) and lead to reduced days of hospitalization (long-term outcome) due to secondary complications.This pilot study is a two-group RCT with an embedded qualitative component. The target population is adults with SCI who have been discharged from inpatient rehabilitation and living in the community.

Given their extensive and specialized knowledge regarding medication efficacy, safety, and cost-effective use as well as their ability to critically review, interpret and apply the results from clinical studies to patient care, clinical pharmacy specialists have the potential to have a significant impact on stroke care delivery. There are numerous opportunities for clinical pharmacy specialists to become more extensively involved in the delivery of care to these high-risk patients. However, to-date there are few studies demonstrating the impact of clinical pharmacy specialists on outcomes of patients with stroke Stroke is the third leading cause of death in the United States (U.S.) and the most common life-threatening neurologic disorder.1 Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability and results in significant individual and societal financial burdens. In 2006, stroke accounted for 1 of every 18 deaths and ischemic stroke accounted for 87% of all strokes.1 In the U.S., out of the approximately 795,000 people who develop a stroke each year, approximately 185,000 (23%) are recurrent events.1 After the first year, the average annual risk for recurrent stroke is 4%.2 Patients who survive at least 30 days after a first-ever stroke, have an average annual risk of death of 9.1%, much of the risk due to nonstroke cardiovascular disease.

Despite the evidence supporting the use of various therapeutic interventions within the ischemic stroke population, a significant proportion of patients continue to have uncontrolled risk factors and remain undertreated.26-30 A recent prospective study of more than 4933 high-risk patients reported that, as compared to patients with coronary artery disease, patients with cerebrovascular disease are undertreated and thus less likely to achieve blood pressure (45.3% vs. 57.3%; p<0.001) and lipid (19.4% vs. 30.5%; p<0.001) targets.28 Although the reasons for the so-called ""treatment gap"" have not been explored specifically within this population, data from studies within the coronary artery disease population suggest that provider, patient and health care system factors likely all contribute.

This will be the first, prospective, randomized study to evaluate the impact of a clinical pharmacist disease management program on both surrogate and clinical outcomes for patients with non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke.

176,NCT02429596,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"A Randomized Controlled Trial of Generic Substitution of Antiepileptic Drugs | Background. Anecdotal reports and uncontrolled studies have described an association between generic substitution of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and adverse events, including loss of seizure control. Although these results are likely to be influenced by methodological bias, they have led to a strong opposition, among physicians and patients, to the use of generic products in epilepsy.

Objectives. The primary objective is to assess potential risks associated with substitution of the currently taken AED product with an equivalent product, using as endpoint changes in serum drug levels at steady-state after substitution compared with baseline. Secondary objectives will be the assessment of inter-subject variability in serum drug concentration on an unchanged treatment schedule, and evaluation of potential short-term changes in seizure control and adverse events rate.

Methods. The study will use an experimental randomized open-label non-inferiority design. The population will consist of 200 adults stabilized on chronic treatment with carbamazepine, valproic acid, topiramate, oxcarbazepine, levetiracetam or lamotrigine and admitted to hospital for diagnostic evaluation or other indications, with no expected treatment changes during the subsequent 5 to 6 days. Patients will be randomized to two groups. One group will continue to receive the AED products used before enrollment (brand or generic), whereas the other group will be switched to an alternative equivalent product. Dosing schedules of the AEDs being tested as well as comedications will be unaltered throughout the 6- to 7day period of the study.

Patient-controlled intravenous analgesia has been used in many medical centers for post-hepatectomy analgesia, but the effects are limited and often cause undesirable adverse effects.

Regional Block has been used for postoperative analgesia in many surgeries. Some studies suggest that regional analgesia has an opioid-sparing effect and can reduce the incidence of chronic pain. Also, the programmed intermittent bolus infusion is better than continuous infusion, with less analgesic consumption and fewer adverse effects.

Studies on the early and late postoperative analgesia and recovery effects of paravertebral block for open hepatectomy are scarce.

This stage 2 efficacy clinical trial seeks to establish the effects of culturally and linguistically tailored speech-language interventions administered to bilingual individuals with PPA.

The overall aim of the intervention component of this study is to establish the relationships between the bilingual experience (e.g., how often each language is used, how ""strong"" each language is) and treatment response of bilinguals with PPA. Specifically, the investigators will evaluate the benefits of tailored speech-language intervention administered in both languages to bilingual individuals with PPA (60 individuals will be recruited). The investigators will conduct an assessment before treatment, after treatment and at two follow-ups (6 and 12-months post-treatment) in both languages. When possible, a structural scan of the brain (magnetic resonance image) will be collected before treatment in order to identify if brain regions implicated in bilingualism are associated with response to treatment. In addition to the intervention described herein, 30 bilingual individuals with PPA will be recruited to complete behavioral cognitive-linguistic testing and will not receive intervention.

The core content of each intervention has been retained in order to maintain or improve their efficacy, and each has been modified to a 4-week group format to increase efficiency of delivery. These modified interventions (ESML-Social and ESML-Ex) will be compared to each other and to a usual care (UC) control group. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 1-month post treatment, and 4 month follow-up. Primary outcomes at the 1-month assessment include: social activity participation, family communication, physical activity participation, and physical function. Primary outcomes at 4-month follow up include overall quality of life and depression. It is hypothesized that ESML-Ex and ESML-Social both will have greater improvements than UC. It is hypothesized that ESML-Social will have greater improvements in social participation and family communication than ESML-Ex and UC. It is hypothesized that ESML-Ex will have greater improvements in physical activity participation and physical functioning than ESML-Social and UC. If successful, these 4-week programs may be developed into ""modules"" that can be incorporated into programming for individuals with early stage dementia in a variety of community settings.","[(22, 42, 'CONDITION', 'Early Stage Dementia'), (75, 94, 'CONDITION', ""Alzheimer's disease""), (96, 98, 'CONDITION', 'AD'), (209, 211, 'CONDITION', 'AD'), (554, 562, 'CONDITION', 'dementia'), (1360, 1371, 'OTHER', 'ESML-Social'), (1376, 1383, 'OTHER', 'ESML-Ex'), (1425, 1435, 'CONTROL', 'usual care'), (1437, 1439, 'CONTROL', 'UC'), (1813, 1820, 'OTHER', 'ESML-Ex'), (1825, 1836, 'OTHER', 'ESML-Social'), (1878, 1880, 'CONTROL', 'UC'), (1906, 1917, 'OTHER', 'ESML-Social'), (2003, 2010, 'OTHER', 'ESML-Ex'), (2015, 2017, 'CONTROL', 'UC'), (2043, 2050, 'OTHER', 'ESML-Ex'), (2147, 2158, 'OTHER', 'ESML-Social'), (2163, 2165, 'CONTROL', 'UC'), (2299, 2319, 'CONDITION', 'early stage dementia')]","[(22, 42), (75, 94), (96, 98), (209, 211), (554, 562), (1360, 1371), (1376, 1383), (1425, 1435), (1437, 1439), (1813, 1820), (1825, 1836), (1878, 1880), (1906, 1917), (2003, 2010), (2015, 2017), (2043, 2050), (2147, 2158), (2163, 2165), (2299, 2319)]","[(22, 42, 'CONDITION'), (75, 94, 'CONDITION'), (96, 98, 'CONDITION'), (209, 211, 'CONDITION'), (554, 562, 'CONDITION'), (2299, 2319, 'CONDITION')]","[(1360, 1371, 'OTHER'), (1376, 1383, 'OTHER'), (1425, 1435, 'CONTROL'), (1437, 1439, 'CONTROL'), (1813, 1820, 'OTHER'), (1825, 1836, 'OTHER'), (1878, 1880, 'CONTROL'), (1906, 1917, 'OTHER'), (2003, 2010, 'OTHER'), (2015, 2017, 'CONTROL'), (2043, 2050, 'OTHER'), (2147, 2158, 'OTHER'), (2163, 2165, 'CONTROL')]"

The hypothesis was that the incidence of symptomatic urinary tract infections would be significantly reduced (by 25%) in users of the SpeediCath hydrophilic catheter when compared to users of a reused polyvinyl chloride (PVC) catheter. Subjects were randomly assigned to either starting the study with PVC catheter for 6 months followed by the hydrophilic catheter for 6 months or visa versa. Each subject kept a weekly diary recording urinary tract infections symptoms, hematuria determined by urine dipstick, physician visits, days of missed school and other activities. At the end of each 6 months subjects completed a questionnaire recording their comfort and satisfaction in using the PVC or hydrophilic coated catheter. 70 subjects were randomized and 46 had complete data. There were no differences in febrile UTI, antibiotic use, healthcare visits or school days missed. The incidence of self reported UTI was lower in the PVC group than the hydrophilic group. 40% of subjects indicated that the hydrophilic coated catheter was slippery and difficult to handle compared to 10% for the PVC catheter. However overall satisfaction was no different between products. The study results are consistent with the current Cochrane Review that there is a lack of evidence to state that the incidence of UTI is affected by multiuse or hydrophilic catheter use.","[(33, 69, 'CONDITION', 'Symptomatic Urinary Tract Infections'), (87, 99, 'CONDITION', 'Spina Bifida'), (106, 165, 'OTHER', 'Hydrophilic or Non-hydrophilic Polyvinyl Chloride Catheters'), (170, 204, 'CONDITION', 'Clean Intermittent Catheterization'), (298, 329, 'OTHER', 'SpeediCath hydrophilic catheter'), (360, 396, 'CONDITION', 'symptomatic urinary tract infections'), (419, 431, 'CONDITION', 'spina bifida'), (544, 580, 'CONDITION', 'symptomatic urinary tract infections'), (637, 668, 'OTHER', 'SpeediCath hydrophilic catheter'), (704, 737, 'CONTROL', 'polyvinyl chloride (PVC) catheter'), (805, 817, 'CONTROL', 'PVC catheter'), (847, 867, 'OTHER', 'hydrophilic catheter'), (1193, 1227, 'OTHER', 'PVC or hydrophilic coated catheter'), (1320, 1323, 'CONDITION', 'UTI'), (1413, 1416, 'CONDITION', 'UTI'), (1507, 1534, 'OTHER', 'hydrophilic coated catheter'), (1596, 1608, 'CONTROL', 'PVC catheter'), (1804, 1807, 'CONDITION', 'UTI'), (1823, 1859, 'OTHER', 'multiuse or hydrophilic catheter use')]","[(33, 69), (87, 99), (106, 165), (170, 204), (298, 329), (360, 396), (419, 431), (544, 580), (637, 668), (704, 737), (805, 817), (847, 867), (1193, 1227), (1320, 1323), (1413, 1416), (1507, 1534), (1596, 1608), (1804, 1807), (1823, 1859)]","[(33, 69, 'CONDITION'), (87, 99, 'CONDITION'), (170, 204, 'CONDITION'), (360, 396, 'CONDITION'), (419, 431, 'CONDITION'), (544, 580, 'CONDITION'), (1320, 1323, 'CONDITION'), (1413, 1416, 'CONDITION'), (1804, 1807, 'CONDITION')]","[(106, 165, 'OTHER'), (298, 329, 'OTHER'), (637, 668, 'OTHER'), (704, 737, 'CONTROL'), (805, 817, 'CONTROL'), (847, 867, 'OTHER'), (1193, 1227, 'OTHER'), (1507, 1534, 'OTHER'), (1596, 1608, 'CONTROL'), (1823, 1859, 'OTHER')]"

Exendin-4 (or Exenatide) is a medication currently used to treat diabetes that has shown promising results in animal and cellular models of Alzheimer's disease. It is possible that Exendin-4 may be a treatment for Alzheimer's disease, which involves the gradual deterioration and death of neurons. Researchers are interested in studying the safety and comparing the effects of Exendin-4 with placebo on cognitive performance, clinical progression of dementia, various chemicals measured in blood and cerebrospinal fluid, and brain MRI, in individuals with early-stage Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment.

Objectives:

To determine the safety and tolerability of twice daily administration of Exendin-4, as well as to acquire preliminary evidence for effects on cognitive performance, clinical progression of dementia, various chemicals measured in blood and cerebrospinal fluid, and brain MRI, in individuals with early-stage Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment.

Eligibility:

Individuals at least 60 years of age who have objective evidence of early-stage Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment in screening testing.

Design:

Participants will be screened.
Following the telephone screening, two in-person screening visits to determine eligibility.
The screening visit will involve a medical history and neurological examination, tests of memory and cognition, a lumbar puncture, collection of blood and saliva samples, and brain Magnetic Resonance Imagine (MRI) studies. Participants will be required to appoint a Durable Power of Attorney for research and medical care during this protocol.
Eligible participants will be divided into two groups (double-blind randomization). One group will receive Exendin-4 SC twice daily, and the other will receive a placebo. Participants will keep a medication diary and will be scheduled for additional study visits 1 and 2 weeks after the start of the treatment.
Participants will have regular followup visits with blood tests, cognitive tests, imaging studies, and other examinations 6, 12, and 18 months after the start of the treatment.

Onset during adolescence can be disruptive to schoolwork and social relationships and if left untreated can lead to recurrence during adulthood, as well as the development of other mental health problems. Current treatments for depression (for both adults and young people) largely focus on reducing low mood and do not effectively tackle the other hallmark symptom of depression, anhedonia, which is characterised as a loss of enjoyment/ pleasure for previously enjoyed activities. Anhedonia is associated with increased risk of suicidality, so should be an important treatment target.

223,NCT04164810,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"Effects of Hydrotherapy on Neuropathic Pain and Pain Catastrophization in Spinal Cord Injury: Study Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial | Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) is a spinal cord injury of traumatic origin with its main etiology being violence, which constitutes one of the greatest social and health problems worldwide. One of the complications with the greatest impact in people with SCI is Neuropathic Pain (NP). Pain, mainly chronic pain, has an effect on emotional states, cognition regarding pain and anticipation which leads to the catastrophization of the pain. This form of pain is related to chronic diseases that develop with pain of poor prognosis and are detrimental to quality of life therefore having enormous impacts on health systems. The physiological mechanisms of Hydrotherapy on pain are clear and there is evidence of its use in the management of painful syndromes of difficult treatments such as that for fibromyalgia and chronic lumbar pain, as well as its positive effect on pain perception. However, the effects of hydrotherapy on the NP of patients with SCI are unknown.

Randomized, controlled clinical trial of parallel groups. A randomized sequence will be carried out in balanced blocks to assign the intervention (Hydrotherapy) or the control (Standard Physical Therapy), to a sample of 28 participants, 14 for each group. Each of the interventions (hydrotherapy and physical therapy) will last 9 weeks, for a total of 18 sessions (2 weekly sessions). Two measurements will be made, baseline (pre-intervention) and a second time one month after the end of the intervention. The validated Spanish scales will be used: NP-4 (NP Screening), Numerical Pain Scale (END), PCS (Pain Catastrophization), SF-36 (Health-related quality of life) and WHODAS 2.0 (Disability). The primary outcome is the level of NP and its catastrophization, and the secondary outcomes are level of disability and quality of life. With 28 participants fully measured, it is possible to have 80% power to find differences between the groups with respect to the primary outcomes. All information will be analyzed using average comparisons with 95% confidence. The analysis will be carried out by Intention to Treat (ITT) taking all the randomized participants. Missing data will be processed through multiple imputation chains. Generalized mixed linear models will be used comparing the standardized baseline and post-intervention averages of each group and between each group, obtaining 95% confidence intervals and p-values. Subgroup analysis will be performed adjusting confounders and interactions. A significant difference will be considered when the value of p is less than 0.05. Cohen´s D will be calculated to identify the size of the intervention effect.

Discussion: The results will reflect the effect of the hydrotherapy on NP in patients with SCI. They will also permit the identification of potential changes in functionality levels or quality of life in the intervened population.","[(11, 23, 'PHYSICAL', 'Hydrotherapy'), (27, 43, 'CONDITION', 'Neuropathic Pain'), (48, 70, 'CONDITION', 'Pain Catastrophization'), (74, 92, 'CONDITION', 'Spinal Cord Injury'), (145, 163, 'CONDITION', 'Spinal Cord Injury'), (165, 168, 'CONDITION', 'SCI'), (175, 193, 'CONDITION', 'spinal cord injury'), (394, 397, 'CONDITION', 'SCI'), (401, 417, 'CONDITION', 'Neuropathic Pain'), (419, 421, 'CONDITION', 'NP'), (424, 428, 'CONDITION', 'Pain'), (437, 449, 'CONDITION', 'chronic pain'), (506, 510, 'CONDITION', 'pain'), (572, 576, 'CONDITION', 'pain'), (591, 595, 'CONDITION', 'pain'), (645, 649, 'CONDITION', 'pain'), (792, 804, 'PHYSICAL', 'Hydrotherapy'), (808, 812, 'CONDITION', 'pain'), (968, 972, 'CONDITION', 'pain'), (1008, 1012, 'CONDITION', 'pain'), (1049, 1061, 'PHYSICAL', 'hydrotherapy'), (1069, 1071, 'CONDITION', 'NP'), (1089, 1092, 'CONDITION', 'SCI'), (1254, 1266, 'PHYSICAL', 'Hydrotherapy'), (1284, 1309, 'CONTROL', 'Standard Physical Therapy'), (1390, 1402, 'PHYSICAL', 'hydrotherapy'), (1407, 1423, 'CONTROL', 'physical therapy'), (1706, 1709, 'CONDITION', 'PCS'), (1711, 1733, 'CONDITION', 'Pain Catastrophization'), (1840, 1842, 'CONDITION', 'NP'), (2829, 2841, 'PHYSICAL', 'hydrotherapy'), (2845, 2847, 'CONDITION', 'NP'), (2865, 2868, 'CONDITION', 'SCI')]","[(11, 23), (27, 43), (48, 70), (74, 92), (145, 163), (165, 168), (175, 193), (394, 397), (401, 417), (419, 421), (424, 428), (437, 449), (506, 510), (572, 576), (591, 595), (645, 649), (792, 804), (808, 812), (968, 972), (1008, 1012), (1049, 1061), (1069, 1071), (1089, 1092), (1254, 1266), (1284, 1309), (1390, 1402), (1407, 1423), (1706, 1709), (1711, 1733), (1840, 1842), (2829, 2841), (2845, 2847), (2865, 2868)]","[(27, 43, 'CONDITION'), (48, 70, 'CONDITION'), (74, 92, 'CONDITION'), (145, 163, 'CONDITION'), (165, 168, 'CONDITION'), (175, 193, 'CONDITION'), (394, 397, 'CONDITION'), (401, 417, 'CONDITION'), (419, 421, 'CONDITION'), (424, 428, 'CONDITION'), (437, 449, 'CONDITION'), (506, 510, 'CONDITION'), (572, 576, 'CONDITION'), (591, 595, 'CONDITION'), (645, 649, 'CONDITION'), (808, 812, 'CONDITION'), (968, 972, 'CONDITION'), (1008, 1012, 'CONDITION'), (1069, 1071, 'CONDITION'), (1089, 1092, 'CONDITION'), (1706, 1709, 'CONDITION'), (1711, 1733, 'CONDITION'), (1840, 1842, 'CONDITION'), (2845, 2847, 'CONDITION'), (2865, 2868, 'CONDITION')]","[(11, 23, 'PHYSICAL'), (792, 804, 'PHYSICAL'), (1049, 1061, 'PHYSICAL'), (1254, 1266, 'PHYSICAL'), (1284, 1309, 'CONTROL'), (1390, 1402, 'PHYSICAL'), (1407, 1423, 'CONTROL'), (2829, 2841, 'PHYSICAL')]"

229,NCT03369587,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"Handwriting Interventions for People With Parkinson's | Background: Problems with handwriting are frustrating and debilitating and affect the majority of people with Parkinson's. Manifest as micrographia it is a distinctive feature of the condition characterised by small handwriting and/or a progressive reduction in size through a sentence[2] coupled with a reduction in writing speed and legibility.

In Parkinson's impaired automaticity is thought to contribute to handwriting deficits and attention has been shown to improve both 'consistent' (small handwriting) and 'progressive' (progressive reduction in letter size through a sentence) aspects of the symptom. Moreover, recent interventional studies indicate handwriting may be improved through practice. This study is investigating a novel handwriting practice stimulus to improve symptoms of micrograpthia

Question: Is a diverging line cued handwriting intervention potentially more effective at improving symptoms of mircograpthia than a parallel line cued handwriting intervention in people with Parkinson's?

Specifically, an assessor blind randomised controlled exploratory trial will:

Estatimate the effect of the intervention on measures of: Handwriting amplitude (consistent and progressive reduction), hand writing performance and percieved handwriting difficulties.
Explore the appropriateness of these outcome measures
Explore the approriateness of eligibilty criteria
Explore intervention fidelity
Explore participants views of the intervention

Design: A phase II exploratory randomised controlled trial of a handwriting intervention with an active comparator control group and blinded assessments

Setting: The intervention will be carried out at home

Sample size: This study is not designed to determine efficacy. The aim to recruit a total of 50 people (25 people per group) in order to estimate the effects on outcome measures and achieve the aims of this exploratory trial.

Assessment: Participants will be asked to follow their usual Parkinson's medication regime and if they have ON and OFF periods, assessments will be carried out during ON state.

245,NCT05395494,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"A Randomized Controlled Trial of Adjunctive D-Cycloserine to Intermittent Theta-burst Stimulation Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in Fibromyalgia | Background & Rationale: Fibromyalgia is characterized by widespread pain, fatigue, mood and anxiety as well as cognitive complaints. For an unacceptable proportion of patients, depressive symptoms remain impairing despite multiple treatments.

For such patients, novel treatments include non-invasive brain stimulation. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) targeting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) or the primary motor cortex (M1) is the non-invasive neurostimulation method with the largest evidence base in fibromyalgia. It involves generating magnetic fields outside of the body to change the firing of neurons in the brain, and has a very favorable tolerability profile. Recent meta-analyses indicate that both the DLPFC and M1 targets are associated with improvements in pain, mood and anxiety, however the benefits are more persistent when the DLPFC is targeted (Su et al, 2021 - J Clin Med). The DLPFC is important in fibromyalgia through its implication in several symptoms domains in fibromyalgia, as well as pain catastrophization.

The researchers neurophysiological data and clinical data in depression suggests that the researchers can enhance the effects of TMS by using an adjunctive medication called D-Cycloserine (DCS, 100mg) in conjunction with a protocol called intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS). Specifically, this data indicated that several converging features of fibromyalgia improve with augmented iTBS, specifically depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, fatigue, and cognitive function. The researchers therefore hypothesize that the combination of D-cycloserine and TMS will lead to greater improvements in fibromyalgia symptoms than TMS alone.

Although iTBS has not yet been studied in fibromyalgia, it has a well characterized neurophysiological effect and been shown to be non-inferior to conventional TMS protocols in conditions such as depression.

The investigators propose to study a comprehensive delirium prevention bundle that has been effective against delirium in preliminary studies in elderly in-hospital patients and elderly ICU patients. This delirium prevention bundle includes the novel addition of psychiatrists to daily ICU rounds, as these professionals are specially trained to screen for latent mental illness and provide treatment for these illnesses. The effects of daily psychiatric evaluation of ICU patients has never been systematically studied, as ICU professionals are well-equipped to manage ICU delirium. Psychiatric consultation is reserved for severe and/or refractory cases of delirium. The investigators hypothesize that a multidisciplinary rounding approach including psychiatry within the ICU team will help diagnose psychiatric components that may contribute to delirium at an earlier time point, and thus can reduce the incidence and duration of delirium.

In addition, ECT cannot be precisely targeted, since it relies on unpredictable pathways of electrical conduction through the brain.

MST uses magnetic fields rather than electrical stimuli for seizure induction, dramatically reducing the passage of induced current through undesired brain regions. 10 years of experimental studies have established the safety of MST in animal and human subjects.

Obesity is a major source of morbidity and mortality in this population. It can lead to sleep apnea, cor pulmonale, diabetes mellitus, and atherosclerosis. PWS has distinct characteristics that set it apart from other forms of obesity including insatiable appetite and food-seeking behavior which can be disruptive to home and school activities, and can cause severe social and psychological turmoil within families. PWS is also associated with unique hormonal abnormalities, most notably hyperghrelinemia. Ghrelin is a gut hormone produced in the stomach that stimulates food intake during a fast. It is hypothesized that the extremely high ghrelin levels in patients with PWS may cause or contribute to their insatiable appetite. Exenatide, a medication used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults, appears to suppress ghrelin levels and cause weight loss. It was designed to mimic glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), an incretin hormone that stimulates insulin secretion and delays gastric emptying, among other effects. In the present study, the investigators will investigate the effects of a 6 month trial of exenatide in overweight adolescents with PWS.

255,NCT02139436,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"Hybrid-FES Exercise to Prevent Cardiovascular Declines in Acute SCI | Each year, 11,000 people suffer a spinal cord injury (SCI) in the U.S. Within the first year, there are profound declines in physiologic function, forming the underlying substrate for future cardiovascular disease . In fact, acquired cardiovascular disease is an increasingly recognized consequence of SCI and is the leading cause of death in SCI. Though incompletely understood, the almost 10-fold prevalence of cardiovascular disease results in part from profound physiologic 'detraining' resulting from motor impairment and immobility. Currently, effective interventions preventing acute declines that lead to cardiovascular compromise and increased risk in SCI are lacking - exercise therapy for those with SCI is challenging and when employed, is typically limited to the upper body. Recently, the investigators refined a unique form of exercise for those with SCI that specifically mirrors exercise performed by those without SCI. Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) Row Training (RT) couples volitional arm and electrically controlled leg exercise, resulting in a hemodynamic profile that produces the beneficial cardiac loading conditions of large muscle mass exercise. As such, FES-RT may be a safe and effective way to attenuate cardiovascular declines following SCI. The investigators aims are to test the overall hypotheses that FES-RT will: 1) mitigate against increased visceral adiposity and reduced insulin sensitivity, 2) prevent worsening lipid profile and compromised baroreflex function, and 3) counter ventricular wall thickening and declining ventricular function occurring with acute SCI, and that these effects will be greater than that observed with an arms-only exercise group.

Patients with a contraindication to TTE will be excluded.

For patients in the NNICU, basic hemodynamic variables (systemic blood pressure, central venous pressure, etc.) will be collected. In addition, left ventricular performance (including estimates of LVEDV, LVESV, EF, FAC, and SV) will be assessed using TTE. Once these baseline data are recorded, the ITPR will be inserted in the ventilator circuit and activated to provide either -5 mm Hg or -9 mm Hg endotracheal rube pressure (ETP) (based on a randomization scheme). After the ITPR has been active for at least five minutes, the same intracranial, hemodynamic, and TTE data obtained above will be gathered. The ITPR will then be turned off for five minutes, and intracranial, hemodynamic, and TTE data will again be recorded. The ITPR will be activated a second time (-9 mm Hg or -5 mm Hg ETP, i.e. whichever value was not used previously), and after five minutes of use data will be recorded again. The ITPR will then be disconnected, data will be collected after waiting two minutes, and no further interventions will be made.

ABG's will be obtained before and during the use of the device at each setting.

This is a proof of concept/feasibility study designed to test the primary hypothesis that use of the ITPR will result in decreased intracranial pressure and increased cerebral perfusion pressure. The effect of the ITPR on secondary indicators of cardiac performance will also be examined. These include but are not limited estimates of ventricular end diastolic volume and pressure (LVEDV/P), ejection fraction (EF), left ventricular end systolic volume and pressure (LVESV/P), fractional area change (FAC), all of which will be assessed by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) or transesophageal echocardiography (TEE).","[(31, 63, 'OTHER', 'Intrathoracic Pressure Regulator'), (65, 69, 'OTHER', 'ITPR'), (127, 157, 'CONDITION', 'Altered Intracranial Elastance'), (864, 868, 'OTHER', 'ITPR'), (1043, 1047, 'OTHER', 'ITPR'), (1177, 1181, 'OTHER', 'ITPR'), (1296, 1300, 'OTHER', 'ITPR'), (1470, 1474, 'OTHER', 'ITPR'), (1778, 1782, 'OTHER', 'ITPR'), (1891, 1895, 'OTHER', 'ITPR')]","[(31, 63), (65, 69), (127, 157), (864, 868), (1043, 1047), (1177, 1181), (1296, 1300), (1470, 1474), (1778, 1782), (1891, 1895)]","[(127, 157, 'CONDITION')]","[(31, 63, 'OTHER'), (65, 69, 'OTHER'), (864, 868, 'OTHER'), (1043, 1047, 'OTHER'), (1177, 1181, 'OTHER'), (1296, 1300, 'OTHER'), (1470, 1474, 'OTHER'), (1778, 1782, 'OTHER'), (1891, 1895, 'OTHER')]"

In about 60% of cases, motor disabilities are associated with cognitive deficits. The present study aims to compare three forms of cognitive / motor rehabilitation in three groups of patients with MS: rehabilitation of verbal memory with the Rehacom program; combined rehabilitation, associating a motor rehabilitation path with the Rehacom program; only motor rehabilitation course. Aims of the study will be: to verify whether the combined cognitive / motor rehabilitation can induce a significantly greater improvement in the memory performance of patients with MS compared to rehabilitation alone; check whether any improvement is objectively verifiable by patients and the impact it may have on patients' quality of life; monitor these effects after 6 months.

For these purposes, three homogeneous groups of 20 patients each will be enrolled, diagnosed with MS according to Mc Donald's criteria revisited by Polman (2011).

Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS), n. It occurs as a result of compression of the medianus as it passes through the carpal tunnel, a narrow osteofibrous canal. CTS is the most common entrapment neuropathy of the upper extremity, affecting approximately 3% of the general adult population.

This study, which was designed as a randomized controlled study, will include 36 patients with CTS, aged between 18-65, who applied to Kırşehir Ahi Evran University Training and Research Hospital. In our study, both groups will be given 10 minutes of paraffin, 20 minutes of TENS, and 10 repetitions of tendon gliding exercise, 3 days a week for a total of 3 weeks (9 sessions). EESDT will be applied once a week in both groups (one group at 4 bar and the other at 1.5 bar pressure). Measurements will be made before treatment, after treatment, and at 12 weeks post-treatment.

In the literature, different pressure parameters were used in studies examining the efficacy of ESDT in the treatment of CTS. Although ESDT has been shown to have a curative effect on CTS, there is no consensus on which pressure parameter is more effective.

284,NCT02571335,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"Intensity-dependent Impacts of Training on Growth Factors BDNF and Cognitive Functions in Persons With Multiple Sclerosis - a Single-center Randomized Controlled Trial | Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic immune-mediated disease of the central nervous system, accompanied by varying inflammatory manifestations, demyelinization and axonal loss. With chronic progressive or relapsing-remitting disease onsets persons with MS (pwMS) progressively develop impaired functional capacity and show reduced physical activity and cognitive decline compared to healthy controls. The primary aims of rehabilitation in pwMS are therefore to increase levels of activity and participation leading to increase independence of the participants. In general exercise ranges from passive physiotherapy-based interventions to submaximal endurance training sessions. Current recommendations advise pwMS that exercise should be matched with the individual performance capacities. Exercise training in pwMS then has the potential to target and improve many components outlined in the ICF-model.

Cytokines and neurotrophic factors have received increased attention in MS research and addressed the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) as an important mediator of neuronal regeneration linking the effects of exercise with MS pathogenesis. Data show positive connections between elevated neurotrophin concentrations, induction of neuroplasticity, recovery of the motor and cognitive functions and the applied training intensities. Similarly, intensive and progressive exercise bouts seem to have greater benefits on cardiorespiratory fitness and maximum voluntary strength in elderly and seniors with dementia. Therefore, specific exercise prescriptions may be necessary for targeting the specific impairments also in pwMS.

This study aims to evaluate two different training modalities (intensive versus normal) in pwMS. It is expected that both modalities will improve cardiorespiratory fitness and cognitive functions in pwMS. Based on the findings that higher training intensities facilitate greater benefits, it is expected that pwMS will tolerate the intensive training intensities and show positive connections to elevated neurotrophin concentrations.

The results will to help to clearer understand the benefits of each type of exercise conveyed for pwMS and will assist in the development of patient-specific exercise prescriptions.","[(103, 121, 'CONDITION', 'Multiple Sclerosis'), (170, 188, 'CONDITION', 'Multiple Sclerosis'), (190, 192, 'CONDITION', 'MS'), (423, 425, 'CONDITION', 'MS'), (455, 483, 'CONDITION', 'impaired functional capacity'), (493, 518, 'CONDITION', 'reduced physical activity'), (523, 540, 'CONDITION', 'cognitive decline'), (889, 897, 'PHYSICAL', 'exercise'), (960, 977, 'PHYSICAL', 'Exercise training'), (1147, 1149, 'CONDITION', 'MS'), (1291, 1299, 'PHYSICAL', 'exercise'), (1305, 1307, 'CONDITION', 'MS'), (1524, 1564, 'PHYSICAL', 'intensive and progressive exercise bouts'), (1713, 1721, 'PHYSICAL', 'exercise'), (1849, 1868, 'PHYSICAL', 'training modalities'), (1870, 1879, 'PHYSICAL', 'intensive'), (1887, 1893, 'CONTROL', 'normal'), (2039, 2066, 'PHYSICAL', 'higher training intensities'), (2139, 2169, 'PHYSICAL', 'intensive training intensities'), (2318, 2326, 'PHYSICAL', 'exercise'), (2400, 2408, 'PHYSICAL', 'exercise')]","[(103, 121), (170, 188), (190, 192), (423, 425), (455, 483), (493, 518), (523, 540), (889, 897), (960, 977), (1147, 1149), (1291, 1299), (1305, 1307), (1524, 1564), (1713, 1721), (1849, 1868), (1870, 1879), (1887, 1893), (2039, 2066), (2139, 2169), (2318, 2326), (2400, 2408)]","[(103, 121, 'CONDITION'), (170, 188, 'CONDITION'), (190, 192, 'CONDITION'), (423, 425, 'CONDITION'), (455, 483, 'CONDITION'), (493, 518, 'CONDITION'), (523, 540, 'CONDITION'), (1147, 1149, 'CONDITION'), (1305, 1307, 'CONDITION')]","[(889, 897, 'PHYSICAL'), (960, 977, 'PHYSICAL'), (1291, 1299, 'PHYSICAL'), (1524, 1564, 'PHYSICAL'), (1713, 1721, 'PHYSICAL'), (1849, 1868, 'PHYSICAL'), (1870, 1879, 'PHYSICAL'), (1887, 1893, 'CONTROL'), (2039, 2066, 'PHYSICAL'), (2139, 2169, 'PHYSICAL'), (2318, 2326, 'PHYSICAL'), (2400, 2408, 'PHYSICAL')]"

290,NCT03047408,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"Evolution of REM Sleep Behavior Disorder in Parkinson's Disease Patients RBD Diagnosed Three Years Earlier | About 60% of Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients have REM sleep Behavior Disorder (RBD), a parasomnia characterized by partial or complete loss of REM sleep muscle atonia and dream-enacting behaviors, usually associated to vivid dreams. The REM Sleep without atonia is the polysomnographic hallmark of RBD, and its quantification is necessary for the diagnosis.

RBD in PD is believed to be a marker of a more widespread degenerative process and a marker of malignant phenotype. Therefore, PD patients with RBD (PD-RBD) are more severely impaired in both motor and non-motor domains, compared to those without RBD, with an increased risk of dementia. However, little is know about the relationship between the evolution of RBD, clinic and video-polysomnographic, and the progression of PD. Besides, an improvement of RBD symptoms is anecdotally reported in PD patients over time. Longitudinal evaluation of RBD in PD, assessed by questionnaires, led to controversial results, but so far, no longitudinal vPSG study has been performed in PD-RBD population.

Thus, the main objective of this study is to longitudinally evaluate clinical and video-polysomnographic features of RBD, including measure of REM Sleep without atonia, in patients with PD-RBD, after three years from the diagnosis of RBD, in order to ascertain whether RBD features remain stable over time.

294,NCT01611987,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"The Role of Exercise in Modifying Outcomes for People With Multiple Sclerosis | Despite the benefits of exercise and physical activity people with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) are relatively inactive. Physical activity is important for persons with disabilities to maintain physical function. A lack of physical activity can contribute to heart disease, osteoporosis, obesity, and diabetes. At the moment, the best way for people with MS to exercise and be physical activity is unknown. People with MS report not knowing what to do. This is a barrier to exercise.

The global aim of this study is to contribute evidence for the role of targeted exercise in altering MS outcomes over time. The design is a randomized controlled trial (RCT). The primary research question is to what extent does an MS Tailored Exercise Program (MSTEP) result in greater improvements in exercise capacity and related outcomes in comparison to a program based on general guidelines for exercise among people with MS who are sedentary and wish to engage in exercise as part of MS self-management. The primary outcome for this question is exercise capacity measured using cycle ergometry. However exercise efficiency, functional ambulation, strength, components of quality of life including frequency and intensity of fatigue symptoms, mood, global physical function, health perception, and illness intrusiveness, will also be measured as components of a global response outcome. The first confirmatory hypothesis is that MSTEP will result in a greater proportion of people making clinically relevant gains (at least 10% change) in exercise capacity than with general guidelines after 12 months of intervention; a secondary hypothesis is that, while there may be some decline in exercise capacity among individuals from end of intervention to follow-up one year later, the decline will be greater in the general guideline group augmenting the difference between groups in the proportion making 10% change from study entry to 24 months. In other words, gains will be maintained more for the MSTEP group over the general guideline group.

An exploratory hypothesis is that more of the targeted outcomes will improve with the MSTEP program than the general guideline approach. An explanatory hypothesis is that these gains will be accompanied by reports of greater exercise enjoyment and exercise self-efficacy (confidence) with the MSTEP program than with the general guideline program leading to more consistent exercise engagement and improved long-term adherence.","[(12, 20, 'PHYSICAL', 'Exercise'), (59, 77, 'CONDITION', 'Multiple Sclerosis'), (104, 112, 'PHYSICAL', 'exercise'), (117, 134, 'PHYSICAL', 'physical activity'), (147, 165, 'CONDITION', 'Multiple Sclerosis'), (167, 169, 'CONDITION', 'MS'), (196, 213, 'PHYSICAL', 'Physical activity'), (298, 315, 'PHYSICAL', 'physical activity'), (430, 432, 'CONDITION', 'MS'), (436, 444, 'PHYSICAL', 'exercise'), (452, 469, 'PHYSICAL', 'physical activity'), (494, 496, 'CONDITION', 'MS'), (549, 557, 'PHYSICAL', 'exercise'), (631, 648, 'PHYSICAL', 'targeted exercise'), (661, 663, 'CONDITION', 'MS'), (791, 819, 'PHYSICAL', 'MS Tailored Exercise Program'), (821, 826, 'PHYSICAL', 'MSTEP'), (920, 968, 'CONTROL', 'program based on general guidelines for exercise'), (987, 989, 'CONDITION', 'MS'), (1050, 1052, 'CONDITION', 'MS'), (1494, 1499, 'PHYSICAL', 'MSTEP'), (1632, 1650, 'CONTROL', 'general guidelines'), (1876, 1893, 'CONTROL', 'general guideline'), (2062, 2067, 'PHYSICAL', 'MSTEP'), (2083, 2100, 'CONTROL', 'general guideline'), (2195, 2200, 'PHYSICAL', 'MSTEP'), (2218, 2235, 'CONTROL', 'general guideline'), (2402, 2407, 'PHYSICAL', 'MSTEP'), (2430, 2447, 'CONTROL', 'general guideline'), (2483, 2491, 'PHYSICAL', 'exercise')]","[(12, 20), (59, 77), (104, 112), (117, 134), (147, 165), (167, 169), (196, 213), (298, 315), (430, 432), (436, 444), (452, 469), (494, 496), (549, 557), (631, 648), (661, 663), (791, 819), (821, 826), (920, 968), (987, 989), (1050, 1052), (1494, 1499), (1632, 1650), (1876, 1893), (2062, 2067), (2083, 2100), (2195, 2200), (2218, 2235), (2402, 2407), (2430, 2447), (2483, 2491)]","[(59, 77, 'CONDITION'), (147, 165, 'CONDITION'), (167, 169, 'CONDITION'), (430, 432, 'CONDITION'), (494, 496, 'CONDITION'), (661, 663, 'CONDITION'), (987, 989, 'CONDITION'), (1050, 1052, 'CONDITION')]","[(12, 20, 'PHYSICAL'), (104, 112, 'PHYSICAL'), (117, 134, 'PHYSICAL'), (196, 213, 'PHYSICAL'), (298, 315, 'PHYSICAL'), (436, 444, 'PHYSICAL'), (452, 469, 'PHYSICAL'), (549, 557, 'PHYSICAL'), (631, 648, 'PHYSICAL'), (791, 819, 'PHYSICAL'), (821, 826, 'PHYSICAL'), (920, 968, 'CONTROL'), (1494, 1499, 'PHYSICAL'), (1632, 1650, 'CONTROL'), (1876, 1893, 'CONTROL'), (2062, 2067, 'PHYSICAL'), (2083, 2100, 'CONTROL'), (2195, 2200, 'PHYSICAL'), (2218, 2235, 'CONTROL'), (2402, 2407, 'PHYSICAL'), (2430, 2447, 'CONTROL'), (2483, 2491, 'PHYSICAL')]"

This has impacts beyond mobility including short and long-term health conditions associated with physical inactivity and different developmental experiences as a result of the mobility impairments. A robotic trainer can both provide rehabilitation and be an assistive device to help compensate for difficulties. Figuring out how to prescribe it is critical to improve daily life for children with significant disabilities. Preliminary use of robotic trainers have shown many benefits, such as better head control and improved independence in transfers, which greatly increases ability to live independently. Additionally, vital functions that are frequently impaired in those with less physical activity, such as sleep and bowel habits, seem to improve. Finally, these children enjoy using them.

This project aims to determine who is most likely to benefit from training with a robotic trainer and investigate key details about the dose of training that is needed. Families that are already using or hope to use robotic training need this data to help improve their access to the intervention. Clinicians need this systematic approach to building evidence to ensure a future multi-centre randomized control trial is well designed. This study is needed to help improve the lives of those who live with significant disabilities. The objective is to evaluate the feasibility and impacts of delivering robotic gait training at home.

Patients will receive 3 sessions of physiotherapy per week for 6 weeks. Each session will last 1 hour during which the patient will be asked to perform specific movements e.g. shuffling cards, reaching for a shelf. With each arm movement the therapist will turn on a stimulator which is worn clipped to the patients ear. This will deliver a short burst of electricity creating a mild tingling sensation.

At the end of the session, the stimulator will be removed and the patient will be asked to rate the level of any discomfort or fatigue they experienced as well as any other side effects. The therapist will also record whether the stimulator device interfered with the therapy in any way. A heart tracing will be performed at each visit to check the heart rhythm. At the start and end of the 6 week course of physiotherapy, patients arm weakness and level of arm function will be assessed, as well as their general levels of fatigue, mood and quality of life. These will be reassessed at 1 month and 6 months after the course of physiotherapy has ended. The investigators will also interview patients to establish how they found the treatment itself.

Participants who successfully complete Week 100 (without meeting study defined withdrawal criteria and who remain virologically suppressed through Week 96: HIV-1 RNA <50 c/mL) will be given the option to switch to the LA arm in the Extension Phase (using an optional oral lead-in with CAB + RPV) or be withdrawn from the study. Participants will continue to receive injections every 4 weeks during the Extension Phase until CAB LA and RPV LA are either locally approved and commercially available, the participant no longer derives clinical benefit, the participant meets a protocol-defined reason for discontinuation, or until development of either CAB LA or RPV LA is terminated.","[(150, 162, 'DRUG', 'Cabotegravir'), (167, 178, 'DRUG', 'Rilpivirine'), (245, 264, 'DRUG', 'Integrase Inhibitor'), (290, 295, 'CONDITION', 'HIV-1'), (305, 333, 'CONDITION', 'Antiretroviral Therapy Naive'), (445, 480, 'CONDITION', 'human immunodeficiency virus type-1'), (482, 487, 'CONDITION', 'HIV-1'), (563, 582, 'DRUG', 'integrase inhibitor'), (715, 727, 'DRUG', 'cabotegravir'), (729, 732, 'DRUG', 'CAB'), (738, 749, 'DRUG', 'rilpivirine'), (751, 754, 'DRUG', 'RPV'), (803, 811, 'DRUG', 'abacavir'), (812, 824, 'DRUG', 'dolutegravir'), (825, 835, 'DRUG', 'lamivudine'), (837, 840, 'DRUG', 'ABC'), (841, 848, 'DRUG', 'DTG/3TC'), (981, 986, 'CONDITION', 'HIV-1'), (1145, 1148, 'DRUG', 'CAB'), (1161, 1164, 'DRUG', 'RPV'), (1237, 1240, 'DRUG', 'ABC'), (1241, 1248, 'DRUG', 'DTG/3TC'), (1277, 1280, 'DRUG', 'CAB'), (1283, 1286, 'DRUG', 'RPV'), (1331, 1350, 'CONDITION', 'HLA-B*5701 positive'), (1402, 1405, 'DRUG', 'DTG'), (1437, 1484, 'DRUG', 'dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor'), (1486, 1490, 'DRUG', 'NRTI'), (1585, 1588, 'DRUG', 'ABC'), (1589, 1596, 'DRUG', 'DTG/3TC'), (1658, 1663, 'CONDITION', 'HIV 1'), (1816, 1819, 'DRUG', 'ABC'), (1820, 1827, 'DRUG', 'DTG/3TC'), (1846, 1849, 'DRUG', 'ABC'), (1850, 1857, 'DRUG', 'DTG/3TC'), (1886, 1889, 'DRUG', 'CAB'), (1898, 1901, 'DRUG', 'RPV'), (1966, 1969, 'DRUG', 'CAB'), (1975, 1978, 'DRUG', 'RPV'), (2206, 2211, 'CONDITION', 'HIV-1'), (2335, 2338, 'DRUG', 'CAB'), (2341, 2344, 'DRUG', 'RPV'), (2474, 2477, 'DRUG', 'CAB'), (2485, 2488, 'DRUG', 'RPV'), (2700, 2703, 'DRUG', 'CAB'), (2710, 2713, 'DRUG', 'RPV')]","[(150, 162), (167, 178), (245, 264), (290, 295), (305, 333), (445, 480), (482, 487), (563, 582), (715, 727), (729, 732), (738, 749), (751, 754), (803, 811), (812, 824), (825, 835), (837, 840), (841, 848), (981, 986), (1145, 1148), (1161, 1164), (1237, 1240), (1241, 1248), (1277, 1280), (1283, 1286), (1331, 1350), (1402, 1405), (1437, 1484), (1486, 1490), (1585, 1588), (1589, 1596), (1658, 1663), (1816, 1819), (1820, 1827), (1846, 1849), (1850, 1857), (1886, 1889), (1898, 1901), (1966, 1969), (1975, 1978), (2206, 2211), (2335, 2338), (2341, 2344), (2474, 2477), (2485, 2488), (2700, 2703), (2710, 2713)]","[(290, 295, 'CONDITION'), (305, 333, 'CONDITION'), (445, 480, 'CONDITION'), (482, 487, 'CONDITION'), (981, 986, 'CONDITION'), (1331, 1350, 'CONDITION'), (1658, 1663, 'CONDITION'), (2206, 2211, 'CONDITION')]","[(150, 162, 'DRUG'), (167, 178, 'DRUG'), (245, 264, 'DRUG'), (563, 582, 'DRUG'), (715, 727, 'DRUG'), (729, 732, 'DRUG'), (738, 749, 'DRUG'), (751, 754, 'DRUG'), (803, 811, 'DRUG'), (812, 824, 'DRUG'), (825, 835, 'DRUG'), (837, 840, 'DRUG'), (841, 848, 'DRUG'), (1145, 1148, 'DRUG'), (1161, 1164, 'DRUG'), (1237, 1240, 'DRUG'), (1241, 1248, 'DRUG'), (1277, 1280, 'DRUG'), (1283, 1286, 'DRUG'), (1402, 1405, 'DRUG'), (1437, 1484, 'DRUG'), (1486, 1490, 'DRUG'), (1585, 1588, 'DRUG'), (1589, 1596, 'DRUG'), (1816, 1819, 'DRUG'), (1820, 1827, 'DRUG'), (1846, 1849, 'DRUG'), (1850, 1857, 'DRUG'), (1886, 1889, 'DRUG'), (1898, 1901, 'DRUG'), (1966, 1969, 'DRUG'), (1975, 1978, 'DRUG'), (2335, 2338, 'DRUG'), (2341, 2344, 'DRUG'), (2474, 2477, 'DRUG'), (2485, 2488, 'DRUG'), (2700, 2703, 'DRUG'), (2710, 2713, 'DRUG')]"

It is not clear what causes schizophrenia, but it's been linked to chemical imbalance in the brain. It is hoped that the study medicine will activate specific sites in the brain to help correct that imbalance. Current treatments for schizophrenia don't work very well and can cause unpleasant side effects. It is hoped that the study medicine will work better, and have fewer side effects than existing medicines.

In this 2 part study (Parts A and B), the primary aim is to assess how safe the study medicine is in healthy men, aged 18-45 years, and how much of it gets into the blood. Its effects on the brain will also be tested.

In Part A, up to 24 participants will receive up to 5 single doses of the study medicine (AUT00206 or placebo) by mouth, either after fasting or after a high fat breakfast. The study medicine has never been given to humans before, so the initial doses will be small and the dose level will be increased as the study progresses. Participants may take up to 14 weeks to finish the study. They'll make up to 22 outpatient visits, and stay on the ward up to 5 times, for 3 nights in a row each time.

In Part B, 24 participants will receive daily doses of the study medicine (AUT00206 or placebo) for up to 28 days. Participants will take up to 10 weeks to finish the study. They'll make 6 outpatient visits, and stay on the ward for up to 30 nights, depending on how long we expect it to take until blood levels of the study medicine level off.

340,NCT01437644,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"Post-operative Pain in Children With Cerebral Palsy Following Major Hip Surgery: a Double Blind Randomised Placebo Controlled Trial of Pre-operative Botulinum Toxin Type A | Cerebral palsy is common. It affects approximately 3 per 1000 children. Hip displacement due to muscle tightness (spasticity) occurs in up to half of the more severely affected children, and many of these children require major (bony) hip surgery. After bony hip surgery the management of pain is very difficult, as spasticity tends to increase and causes painful spasms which are difficult to control. Botulinum Toxin injections are known to reduce spasticity and therefore should also reduce pain. These injections take at least a week to work, but the effects can last for months. Botulinum Toxin is already an established treatment for chronic hip pain prior to surgery. The investigators aim to find out whether Botulinum Toxin injections can reduce post-operative pain. The identification of the level of pain can be challenging because most of these children are unable to communicate verbally. The investigators are therefore using a validated pain scoring tool that was designed especially for such children. This study will be the first to describe fully the pain experience of children with cerebral palsy undergoing this type of major surgery. The investigators will compare Botulinum Toxin injections with placebo (non-active) injections. There is a high emotional and financial burden on the families of these children. Families describe high levels of emotional distress around the time of surgery, particularly when their child is in pain. Difficulty with pain control post operatively may delay discharge from hospital and parental return to work. It causes disrupted sleep for the child and family and may delay the child's return to school. The results of this study will be shared with professionals and families at international conferences and in scientific and popular (patient-based) publications. This study cannot be undertaken in adults with cerebral palsy as they only rarely undergo this sort of surgery.","[(0, 19, 'CONDITION', 'Post-operative Pain'), (37, 51, 'CONDITION', 'Cerebral Palsy'), (62, 79, 'CONDITION', 'Major Hip Surgery'), (107, 114, 'CONTROL', 'Placebo'), (149, 171, 'DRUG', 'Botulinum Toxin Type A'), (174, 188, 'CONDITION', 'Cerebral palsy'), (288, 298, 'CONDITION', 'spasticity'), (396, 420, 'CONDITION', 'major (bony) hip surgery'), (428, 444, 'CONDITION', 'bony hip surgery'), (463, 467, 'CONDITION', 'pain'), (490, 500, 'CONDITION', 'spasticity'), (577, 592, 'DRUG', 'Botulinum Toxin'), (624, 634, 'CONDITION', 'spasticity'), (668, 672, 'CONDITION', 'pain'), (758, 773, 'DRUG', 'Botulinum Toxin'), (814, 830, 'CONDITION', 'chronic hip pain'), (891, 906, 'DRUG', 'Botulinum Toxin'), (929, 948, 'CONDITION', 'post-operative pain'), (985, 989, 'CONDITION', 'pain'), (1126, 1130, 'CONDITION', 'pain'), (1243, 1247, 'CONDITION', 'pain'), (1276, 1290, 'CONDITION', 'cerebral palsy'), (1361, 1376, 'DRUG', 'Botulinum Toxin'), (1393, 1424, 'CONTROL', 'placebo (non-active) injections'), (1624, 1628, 'CONDITION', 'pain'), (1646, 1650, 'CONDITION', 'pain'), (2043, 2057, 'CONDITION', 'cerebral palsy')]","[(0, 19), (37, 51), (62, 79), (107, 114), (149, 171), (174, 188), (288, 298), (396, 420), (428, 444), (463, 467), (490, 500), (577, 592), (624, 634), (668, 672), (758, 773), (814, 830), (891, 906), (929, 948), (985, 989), (1126, 1130), (1243, 1247), (1276, 1290), (1361, 1376), (1393, 1424), (1624, 1628), (1646, 1650), (2043, 2057)]","[(0, 19, 'CONDITION'), (37, 51, 'CONDITION'), (62, 79, 'CONDITION'), (174, 188, 'CONDITION'), (288, 298, 'CONDITION'), (396, 420, 'CONDITION'), (428, 444, 'CONDITION'), (463, 467, 'CONDITION'), (490, 500, 'CONDITION'), (624, 634, 'CONDITION'), (668, 672, 'CONDITION'), (814, 830, 'CONDITION'), (929, 948, 'CONDITION'), (985, 989, 'CONDITION'), (1126, 1130, 'CONDITION'), (1243, 1247, 'CONDITION'), (1276, 1290, 'CONDITION'), (1624, 1628, 'CONDITION'), (1646, 1650, 'CONDITION'), (2043, 2057, 'CONDITION')]","[(107, 114, 'CONTROL'), (149, 171, 'DRUG'), (577, 592, 'DRUG'), (758, 773, 'DRUG'), (891, 906, 'DRUG'), (1361, 1376, 'DRUG'), (1393, 1424, 'CONTROL')]"
341,NCT02167022,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"Intense Physiotherapies to Improve Function in Young Children With Cerebral Palsy | Cerebral palsy (CP) is a non-progressive disorder caused by an insult or injury to the brain when the brain is most rapidly developing and which results in some motor dysfunction. Causes for the injury to the brain are numerous and can occur prior to birth, during the birth process, or within the first few months following birth. The motor dysfunction can involve any or all four extremities but most often affects the legs, causing abnormal ambulation. The level of severity depends on the extent of the injury to the brain and can be mild to severe. In severe instances, the child is dependent on others for all his/her care.

There is no known cure for CP, but physical and occupational therapies are administered in an attempt to improve function. The frequency of these therapies varies from once a week (the standard of care in the Western Hemisphere) to five times a week (the standard of care in Asia and some Eastern European countries). The current understanding of brain plasticity offers a theoretical explanation to justify the more intense approach. Active repetitive motor skill-directed rehabilitation utilizes the plasticity of the brain and can restore some function. Intense active physiotherapy can stimulate non-injured but 'dormant' neurons and prevent their 'natural' degeneration in order for them to substitute for the function of injured neurons. It is the very young brain that is most likely to respond to this therapy.

The aim of this proposal is to evaluate the effect of administering both physical and occupational therapy five times each week for 12 weeks and compare it with the standard of care (SOC) approach of one time each week in children between the ages of 12 months and 36 months. This is the first randomized crossover trial to both enroll this young a population of children with cerebral palsy as well as to evaluate this approach from both the therapists and the parents perspectives. The number of children that this study will enroll is larger than in most CP studies. The children will be evaluated clinically with two validated instruments, one of which was designed specifically for children with CP and is administered and scored by certified therapists and the other which was designed for children with developmental disabilities and is scored by the child's care provider. A sub-set of children will have a special type of MRI to evaluate any changes in the neurological structure of the brain.

The Department of Pediatrics at the University of Arizona recently completed a collaborative study with the Neurologic Department at the Beijing Children's Hospital where the intense approach of five therapies per week is the SOC. The positive results prompted another investigation to determine if such an approach would be feasible in the United States. A compliance rate of 81% confirmed feasibility and the perception that parents who have a child diagnosed with CP will do whatever they can to improve their child's motor function.","[(0, 23, 'PHYSICAL', 'Intense Physiotherapies'), (67, 81, 'CONDITION', 'Cerebral Palsy'), (84, 98, 'CONDITION', 'Cerebral palsy'), (100, 102, 'CONDITION', 'CP'), (245, 262, 'CONDITION', 'motor dysfunction'), (420, 437, 'CONDITION', 'motor dysfunction'), (742, 744, 'CONDITION', 'CP'), (750, 785, 'PHYSICAL', 'physical and occupational therapies'), (1150, 1203, 'PHYSICAL', 'Active repetitive motor skill-directed rehabilitation'), (1272, 1300, 'PHYSICAL', 'Intense active physiotherapy'), (1608, 1641, 'PHYSICAL', 'physical and occupational therapy'), (1700, 1716, 'CONTROL', 'standard of care'), (1718, 1721, 'CONTROL', 'SOC'), (1912, 1926, 'CONDITION', 'cerebral palsy'), (2093, 2095, 'CONDITION', 'CP'), (2236, 2238, 'CONDITION', 'CP'), (2765, 2768, 'CONTROL', 'SOC'), (3006, 3008, 'CONDITION', 'CP')]","[(0, 23), (67, 81), (84, 98), (100, 102), (245, 262), (420, 437), (742, 744), (750, 785), (1150, 1203), (1272, 1300), (1608, 1641), (1700, 1716), (1718, 1721), (1912, 1926), (2093, 2095), (2236, 2238), (2765, 2768), (3006, 3008)]","[(67, 81, 'CONDITION'), (84, 98, 'CONDITION'), (100, 102, 'CONDITION'), (245, 262, 'CONDITION'), (420, 437, 'CONDITION'), (742, 744, 'CONDITION'), (1912, 1926, 'CONDITION'), (2093, 2095, 'CONDITION'), (2236, 2238, 'CONDITION'), (3006, 3008, 'CONDITION')]","[(0, 23, 'PHYSICAL'), (750, 785, 'PHYSICAL'), (1150, 1203, 'PHYSICAL'), (1272, 1300, 'PHYSICAL'), (1608, 1641, 'PHYSICAL'), (1700, 1716, 'CONTROL'), (1718, 1721, 'CONTROL'), (2765, 2768, 'CONTROL')]"

Grade II-III meningiomas progression-free survival (PFS) 6 is at 10-15%. Median PFS grade III meningioma is approximate 3 years.

Alpelisib is a well-tolerated Phosphoinositide 3-kinase α (Pi3Kα) specific inhibitor. However, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition does not induce apoptosis in vitro and induces an antiproliferative effect without any radiologic response in most treated patients.

Trametinib, a mekinist (MEK) inhibitor is currently used in combined treatment for recurrent melanomas in clinical practice with a good clinical tolerance at 1-2 mg daily. In vitro, on meningioma primary cell culture, Trametinib induces cell apoptosis via caspase activity.

These results strongly suggest the relevance to combine Alpelisib and Trametinib in aggressive and recurrent meningiomas.

Alpelisib and Trametinib combination has not been studied to date, despite each drugs have been separately studied in phase 3.

Multicenter, open label, dose-finding phase I study of Alpelisib in combination with Trametinib administered at a fixed dose (1.5 mg daily), both drugs will be administered daily.

In addition, postural disorders, motor freezing, gait disturbances, decreased arm swing and axial rotation loss accompany the disease. There is an important relationship between axial rotation and turning, which is one of many activities in daily life. Parkinson's patients with loss of axial rotation have a difficulty gait, daily living activities and is associated with falls.

Classical physiotherapy methods for Parkinson's patients such as stretching, strengthening and posture exercises, balance, coordination and gait training, and different methods such as motor imagery, sensory stimuli and neurophysiological approaches can be used in the treatment of Parkinson's patients. Although there are applications that can increase axial rotation in physiotherapy programs, all programs may be able to focus adequately on the treatment of this symptom. In addition, according to the literature, the effects of all physiotherapy approaches emerge as a result of long-term training.

Mobilization techniques are applications that are included in physiotherapy programs and have a wide area of use. It is divided into three subtitles according to its severity and degree: Grade A (mobilization), grade B (mobilization) and grade C (manipulation).

Considering the effects of mobilization on muscle activation and balance, grade A and grade B mobilization applications are likely to increase the mobility of this area when applied on the lumbosacral region. Therefore, these practices can affect balance, gait and functional activities by regulating muscle tone (rigidity) and muscle activation and reducing axial symptoms in Parkinson's patients.

In neurodegenerative disorders, neurodegeneration is accompanied by changes in oscillatory activity leading to the emerging concept of neurological and psychiatric disorders as ""oscillopathies"". Alzheimer's disease, which accounts for the vast majority of age-related dementias, is characterised by a prominent disruption of oscillations in the gamma frequency band. The restoration of gamma oscillations by neural entrainment in animal models of Alzheimer's disease have shown a remarkable decrease in the pathological burden of amyloid and tau via increased microglial activity, resulting in a significant increase of cognitive performances.

Transcranial alternating current brain stimulation (tACS), is a neurophysiological method of non-invasive modulation of the excitability of the central nervous system that is having an increasingly numerous spectrum of potential therapeutic applications. Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of this method in modulating the natural frequencies of cerebral oscillation, underlying multiple cognitive processes such as verbal memory, perception and working memory. On the basis of these premises, the treatment with gamma tACS is proposed in patients affected by Alzheimer's disease.

363,NCT04576507,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"Effects of Repeated Cannabis Administration on Experimental Pain and Abuse Liability in Humans | Chronic pain is a significant public health concern in the U.S., for which prescription opioids have historically been the standard treatment. This has resulted in striking rates of opioid use disorders and fatal overdoses. Identifying non-opioid medications for the management of chronic pain with minimal abuse liability is a public health necessity, and cannabinoids are a promising drug class for this purpose. More than 80% of medicinal cannabis users report pain as their primary medical indication. These patients tend to seek products that are low in delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC; the primary psychoactive, and thus intoxicating, component of cannabis), and high in cannabidiol (CBD), a cannabinoid that purportedly has therapeutic benefit for pain but does not produce intoxicating effects [1]. However, there are few well-controlled human laboratory studies assessing the efficacy of high-CBD cannabis for pain in the context of abuse, and even less is known regarding the effects of daily repeated use of cannabis on pain and its relationship to abuse liability.

The proposed randomized, within-subjects, placebo-controlled 16-day crossover inpatient human laboratory pilot study (N = 16 healthy cannabis users; 8 men, 8 women) will address important gaps in our understanding of the potential therapeutic utility of cannabis for pain: 1) If repeated cannabis use can result in hyperalgesia; 2) If tolerance to the analgesic and abuse-related effects of cannabis develops and is reversible. Two distinct modalities of experimental pain will be assessed: The Cold Pressor Test (CPT) and Quantitative Sensory Testing Thermal Temporal Summation (QST-TTS), and participants will smoke cannabis 3x/day.

388,NCT00001785,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"Combined Virological and Immunological Evaluation of Treatment of Patients With Early HTLV-1-Associated Myelopathy With Recombinant Human Interferon Beta-1a | HTLV stands for human T cell leukemia virus. HTLV-1 is a virus that attacks specific kinds of white blood cells called T cells. T cells are part of the natural defense system of the body. HTLV-1 has been associated with leukemia and lymphoma. In addition, approximately 1% of all patients infected with HTLV-1 develops a condition known as HTLV-1 associated myelopathy (HAM) / tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP).

Currently there is no clearly defined, effective treatment for patients with HAM/TSP. Steroids have been used as therapy but have only been able to provide temporary relief of symptoms. Human interferon is a small protein released from different kinds of cells in the body. Interferon has been known to have antiviral and immunological effects and has been used to treat hepatitis and multiple sclerosis. Interferon Beta is released from cells called fibroblasts. These cells play a role in the production of connective tissue.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the possible role of recombinant interferon beta (Avonex) in treatment of HAM/TSP. The study is broken into three phases, a pre-treatment phase, a treatment phase, and a post-treatment phase. The total duration of the study will be 44 weeks.

Patients participating in this study will receive injections of Avonex 1 to 2 times a week.

440,NCT05014841,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"The Neural Coding of Speech Across Human Languages | The overall goal of this study is to reveal the fundamental neural mechanisms that underlie comprehension across human spoken languages. An understanding of how speech is coded in the brain has significant implications for the development of new diagnostic and rehabilitative strategies for language disorders (e.g. aphasia, dyslexia, autism, et alia). The basic mechanisms underlying comprehension of spoken language are unknown. Researchers are only beginning to understand how the human brain extracts the most fundamental linguistic elements (consonants and vowels) from a complex and highly variable acoustic signal. Traditional theories have posited a 'universal' phonetic inventory shared by all humans, but this has been challenged by other newer theories that each language has its own unique and specialized code. An investigation of the cortical representation of speech sounds across languages can likely shed light on this fundamental question. Previous research has implicated the superior temporal cortex in the processing of speech sounds. Most of this work has been entirely carried out in English. The recording of neural activity directly from the cortical surface from individuals with different language experience is a promising approach since it can provide both high spatial and temporal resolution. This study will examine the mechanisms of phonetic encoding, by utilizing neurophysiological recordings obtained during neurosurgical procedures. High-density electrode arrays, advanced signal processing, and direct electrocortical stimulation will be utilized to unravel both local and population encoding of speech sounds in the lateral temporal cortex. This study will also examine the neural encoding of speech in patients who are monolingual and bilingual in Mandarin, Spanish, and English, the most common spoken languages worldwide, and feature important contrastive differences of pitch, formant, and temporal envelope. A cross-linguistic approach is critical for a true understanding of language, while also striving to achieve a broader approach of diversity and inclusion in neuroscience of language.",[],[],[],[]

The purpose of this study is to better characterize the retina and optic nerve in newborns using spectral domain optical coherence tomography (s-oct). This new technology provides a very detailed cross-section picture of the cellular layers in the retina and a 3-dimensional picture of the optic nerve head and the fovea (the center of the retina that provides the most accurate vision). These images have been used by doctors for more than 5 years to help diagnose and treat adults with eye diseases, such as macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, retinal detachments, and melanoma. But, it has never been studied in newborns. In newborns, it would potentially help in the diagnoses of glaucoma, optic nerve hypoplasia, foveal hypoplasia, and colobomata among many other disorders. Prior to diagnosing disorders, it is necessary to establish normal values. It is the purpose of this investigation to study the retina and optic nerves in neonates to establish normal values.

After a parent of a normal newborn provides a written consent, the baby will be taken to the Eye Clinic where the instrument is located. The baby will be swaddled in one or more blankets as needed. The infants will be held in front of the instrument by a nurse. The technician will move the lens of the instrument to about 2 to 4 inches from the baby's eye. The mild light from the instrument will then enter the eye for a few seconds to obtain the desired image. The image can be captured through an immobile eye within 5 seconds. If the baby is fussy, he or she may be given a few drops of a sugar (sucrose) solution on a pacifier for calming. Although the images can usually be secured through a normal pupil, if the pupil is found to be too small, two drops of Cyclomydril will be placed on the eye for dilation. This is the eye drop used everyday in the Eye Clinic and nursery to dilate the pupils of babies. The dilation will last for about 6 to 10 hours. After the test, the baby will return to the nursery or be discharged home as intended by the Neonatology Division.

There is minimal risk associated with this investigation. The instrument is non-invasive and does not touch the eye. The babies will be swaddled and held by a nurse to prevent any contact with the machine. The eye drop to be used if needed for dilation has been used on babies at Harbor for about 30 years. It has been found to very safe. The fact that we will study only term (not premature babies) and will apply only two drops if needed should minimize any risk from the eye drop.

An ethical issue to consider is that while the study will provide important information that will undoubtedly help babies in the future, it will probably not benefit the baby being studied. However, if the baby has an undetected retinal or optic nerve problem, the study may reveal it.",[],[],[],[]
