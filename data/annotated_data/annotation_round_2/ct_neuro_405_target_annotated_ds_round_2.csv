12,NCT03049033,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"Neurologic Music Therapy for Enhancing Fine Motor Control in Parkinson's Disease | Parkinson's Disease (PD) is defined by characteristic motor symptoms including slow movements, small movements, difficulty with movement initiation and disruptions in timing. Besides gross motor symptoms, fine motor impairments in PD cause difficulties with everyday tasks such as writing, self-care, and fine object manipulation. These activity limitations can lead to disability, social isolation, and a reduced quality of life. In a series of breakthrough studies Michael Thaut and colleagues developed Neurologic Music Therapy (NMT) and found it can address many gross motor impairments and improve gait and balance. Other music therapies such as Music-supported Therapy (MST) have proven motor benefits in stroke patients through movement exercises with musical instruments. However, the pathological basal ganglia (BG) in PD brains leads to a reduced supply of those internally generated movements. In contrast, externally cued movements (eg. via a beat or a rhythm) during NMT sessions are instantaneously entrained to the period of a rhythmic stimulus possibly without involvement of the BG. The underlying idea is that rhythm is the essential component relating music specifically to motor behavior. The mechanism of action is called ""rhythmic entrainment"" where one system's motion or signal frequency entrains the frequency of another system. The effect of NMT on fine motor function has not been investigated yet. Music activities are important in the lives of many older adults. Notably, the use of music has been associated with increased well-being for older adults, as it fosters social connection and mood regulation.

Two positive airway pressure (PAP) modalities can be used: Fixed pressure, in which the effective pressure is set and kept constant all night, and auto CPAP devices where the positive pressure changes during the night depend on patient's requirements.

Hypothesis: Pressure variations associated with autoCPAP functioning can lead to sleep fragmentation and alterations in sleep structure. This can limit blood pressure dipping during sleep and then impact clinical blood pressure reduction.

Main objective: To compare in a randomized controlled trial 4 months clinical blood pressure (BP) evolution depending on CPAP mode: fixed pressure versus autoCPAP. Secondary outcomes: Evolution of arterial stiffness, biological parameters, quality of life and symptoms.

Methods: Patients will be randomised depending on CPAP mode. Baseline and 4 months evaluation will include: 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, clinical BP measurements and carotid-to-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV). Patients will also complete quality of life and symptoms questionnaires.

Parkinson's disease with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) frequently results in development of dementia for which few treatment options exist. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is used to alter activity in the outer regions of the brain and has been shown in previous studies to increase cognitive performance in patients with different disorders. This study will investigate the effectiveness of TMS as a clinical treatment for the cognitive deficits associated with Parkinson's disease. 64 male and female participants between the ages of 50 and 90 will attend eight study visits over a period of 63 to 66 days. This study is a double-blind randomized clinical trial meaning the participant will be assigned by chance to either the TMS-treatment group or the Sham-treatment group. Additionally, a combination of memory and thinking tests and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) will be used to see if there are structural and functional changes within the brain. Genotyping and blood analysis before and after treatment for different biomarkers will also be performed and these data will be compared to the TMS data. Initially, this research will increase knowledge about the effects of TMS on various brain regions. Ultimately, we will be able to determine if TMS can be used as a complementary therapy for PD to improve cognitive performance and to reduce progression into dementia.","[(10, 66, 'OTHER', 'Excitatory Theta-Burst Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation'), (102, 121, 'CONDITION', ""Parkinson's Disease""), (126, 151, 'CONDITION', 'Mild Cognitive Impairment'), (228, 247, 'CONDITION', ""Parkinson's disease""), (249, 251, 'CONDITION', 'PD'), (381, 400, 'CONDITION', ""Parkinson's disease""), (406, 431, 'CONDITION', 'Mild Cognitive Impairment'), (433, 436, 'CONDITION', 'MCI'), (475, 483, 'CONDITION', 'dementia'), (523, 556, 'OTHER', 'Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation'), (558, 561, 'OTHER', 'TMS'), (783, 786, 'OTHER', 'TMS'), (854, 873, 'CONDITION', ""Parkinson's disease""), (1120, 1123, 'OTHER', 'TMS'), (1147, 1151, 'CONTROL', 'Sham'), (1492, 1495, 'OTHER', 'TMS'), (1572, 1575, 'OTHER', 'TMS'), (1646, 1649, 'OTHER', 'TMS'), (1693, 1695, 'CONDITION', 'PD'), (1760, 1768, 'CONDITION', 'dementia')]","[(10, 66), (102, 121), (126, 151), (228, 247), (249, 251), (381, 400), (406, 431), (433, 436), (475, 483), (523, 556), (558, 561), (783, 786), (854, 873), (1120, 1123), (1147, 1151), (1492, 1495), (1572, 1575), (1646, 1649), (1693, 1695), (1760, 1768)]","[(102, 121, 'CONDITION'), (126, 151, 'CONDITION'), (228, 247, 'CONDITION'), (249, 251, 'CONDITION'), (381, 400, 'CONDITION'), (406, 431, 'CONDITION'), (433, 436, 'CONDITION'), (475, 483, 'CONDITION'), (854, 873, 'CONDITION'), (1693, 1695, 'CONDITION'), (1760, 1768, 'CONDITION')]","[(10, 66, 'OTHER'), (523, 556, 'OTHER'), (558, 561, 'OTHER'), (783, 786, 'OTHER'), (1120, 1123, 'OTHER'), (1147, 1151, 'CONTROL'), (1492, 1495, 'OTHER'), (1572, 1575, 'OTHER'), (1646, 1649, 'OTHER')]"

Normally, nerve fibers carry electrical impulses through the spinal cord, providing communication between the brain and the arms and legs. In people with MS, the fatty sheath that surrounds and insulates the nerve fibers (called ""myelin"") deteriorates, causing nerve impulses to be slowed or stopped. As a result patients with MS may experience periods of muscle weakness and other symptoms such as numbness, loss of vision, loss of coordination, paralysis, spasticity, mental and physical fatigue and a decrease in the ability to think and/or remember. These periods of illness may come (exacerbations) and go (remissions).

48,NCT04299009,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"Bright Light Therapy for Residual Daytime Symptoms Associated With Obstructive Sleep Apnea | Sleep apnea is one of the most common chronic condition among US military Veterans, causing sleepiness, reduced psychomotor vigilance and depression, which undermine daytime functioning and quality of life. Persistent daytime symptoms of sleepiness in individuals with Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) who are using Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) are associated with adverse long term medical and functional outcomes. Residual daytime sleepiness (RDS) is associated with reduced occupational and family functioning and overall lower quality of life. Napping is a common behavior among individuals with OSA and RDS and has been linked to both benefits to and decline in health and functioning. Longer nap times may maintain, as opposed to decrease, sleepiness by promoting sleep inertia and can contribute to maintaining subclinical circadian alterations that result in higher night-tonight variability in sleep patterns. Preliminary studies in humans and animal models have shown persisting alterations of circadian rhythms in OSA patients, that fail to normalize with CPAP treatment. CPAP treatment, while effective at correcting respiratory events and night time blood oxygen saturation levels, does not necessarily re-align the circadian system. Current treatment options are limited to stimulants and modafinil, whose long-term safety profile, effectiveness and impact on functional recovery is largely unknown. Supplementary exposure to bright light has beneficial effects on sleep quality and daytime vigilance in healthy individuals and it has been increasingly applied in a variety of sleep and neuropsychiatric conditions. However, no study to date has tested the application of BLT to treat daytime symptoms associated with sleep apnea.

Objective and hypothesis to be tested: To examine the effects of a 24-week structured aerobic dance training on cognition, mood, physical and daily functions in stroke and dementia free older adults with SVD, and whether such effects are mediated through improved cerebral vasomotor reactivity (CVR), a marker of cerebral autoregulation which is impaired in SVD.

Design and subjects: Rater-blind RCT comparing the effects of 24-week of structured aerobic dance training upon cognition, mood, physical and daily functions on 110 community dwelling, stroke- and dementia-free persons aged ≥65 with MRI evidence of significant SVD, defined as the presence of multiple (≥2) lacunes and/or early confluent or confluent WML.

Interventions: Participants are randomized in a 1:1 ratio into a 24-week of structured therapist-led group aerobic dance training with home practice or simple stretching plus health education control group.

Main outcome measures: Cognition, mood, physical and daily functions and CVR measured using Transcranial Doppler at baseline, weeks 12, 24 and 36.

Data analysis: Intent-to-treat with multiple imputations with treatment efficacy analyzed using mixed effects models. Mediation effects of CVR between aerobic dance training and treatment outcomes tested using mediation models.

Expected results: In persons with significant SVD, aerobic dance training improves cognitive, mood, physical and daily functions and such effects are mediated by changes in CVR.","[(11, 33, 'PHYSICAL', 'Aerobic Dance Training'), (120, 149, 'CONDITION', 'Cerebral Small Vessel Disease'), (166, 195, 'CONDITION', 'Cerebral small vessel disease'), (197, 200, 'CONDITION', 'SVD'), (351, 354, 'CONDITION', 'SVD'), (449, 452, 'CONDITION', 'SVD'), (541, 563, 'PHYSICAL', 'aerobic dance training'), (659, 662, 'CONDITION', 'SVD'), (813, 816, 'CONDITION', 'SVD'), (903, 925, 'PHYSICAL', 'aerobic dance training'), (1080, 1083, 'CONDITION', 'SVD'), (1283, 1324, 'PHYSICAL', 'aerobic dance training with home practice'), (1328, 1345, 'CONTROL', 'simple stretching'), (1351, 1367, 'CONTROL', 'health education'), (1683, 1705, 'PHYSICAL', 'aerobic dance training'), (1807, 1810, 'CONDITION', 'SVD'), (1812, 1834, 'PHYSICAL', 'aerobic dance training')]","[(11, 33), (120, 149), (166, 195), (197, 200), (351, 354), (449, 452), (541, 563), (659, 662), (813, 816), (903, 925), (1080, 1083), (1283, 1324), (1328, 1345), (1351, 1367), (1683, 1705), (1807, 1810), (1812, 1834)]","[(120, 149, 'CONDITION'), (166, 195, 'CONDITION'), (197, 200, 'CONDITION'), (351, 354, 'CONDITION'), (449, 452, 'CONDITION'), (659, 662, 'CONDITION'), (813, 816, 'CONDITION'), (1080, 1083, 'CONDITION'), (1807, 1810, 'CONDITION')]","[(11, 33, 'PHYSICAL'), (541, 563, 'PHYSICAL'), (903, 925, 'PHYSICAL'), (1283, 1324, 'PHYSICAL'), (1328, 1345, 'CONTROL'), (1351, 1367, 'CONTROL'), (1683, 1705, 'PHYSICAL'), (1812, 1834, 'PHYSICAL')]"

A disorder that primarily affects women, fibromyalgia causes widespread aching and stiffness in muscles. Neurotropin has been used in Japan for many years to treat various chronic painful conditions, including fibromyalgia.

Women with fibromyalgia who have been treated unsuccessfully with standard therapy may be eligible for this study. Patients must have a history of widespread pain for more than half of the days in each of the three months before they enter the study. Candidates are screened with a medical history, physical examination, blood and urine tests, questionnaires and an electrocardiogram (EKG).

Participants take their usual medications for fibromyalgia in addition to either neurotropin or a placebo (look-alike medicine with no active ingredient). At 6 weeks and 12 weeks into the study, they return to the NIH Clinical Center for evaluation of their sensitivity to pain and level of physical capability. After 12 weeks, study subjects ""cross-over"" their medication; that is, patients who took neurotropin for the first 12 weeks of the study take placebo for the next 12 weeks, and vice-versa. Again, after 6 and 12 weeks, patients return for evaluation.

61,NCT01118637,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"Stepped Care in the Treatment of Trichotillomania | Trichotillomania (TTM), repetitive pulling out of one's own hair to the extent that noticeable hair loss occurs, is a distressing condition interfering substantially with functioning and quality of life. The longterm objective of this research is to determine whether psychological treatment of TTM could be disseminated more effectively by using a stepped care model in which less intensive interventions are tried first, with more intensive interventions used only if initial treatment proves insufficient. This project is a pilot study of the first two steps in a stepped care model of treatment. After baseline assessment, 50 participants with TTM will be randomly assigned to (a) Immediate condition, in which they are offered 10-week self-help treatment via an interactive website (Step 1) or (b) Wait List/Delayed Start condition, a 10-week wait list prior to being offered Step 1. In each condition, at the end of Step 1, participants will be offered 8 weeks of in-person habit reversal training provided by psychology graduate students (Step 2). TTM symptoms will be measured from baseline through a follow-up 3 months after the end of Step 2, as will depression, anxiety, quality of life, functional impairment , treatment utilization, and treatment satisfaction.

The specific aims of the study are:

To gather preliminary data on the efficacy of web-based self-help, compared to wait list control;
To characterize the acceptability of stepped care to patients with TTM by assessing the proportion of enrolled participants who proceed from step 1 to step 2 treatment;
To evaluate the convergent validity of four decision rules for concluding that a patient with TTM has benefited sufficiently from a treatment step: (a) No longer meeting TTM diagnostic criteria; (b) Showing a 25% or greater reduction in total scores on self-report and clinician-rated TTM symptoms; (c) achieving complete abstinence from hair-pulling; and (d) clinically significant response on both self-report and clinician-rated TTM symptom measures

The goal of treatment is to improve functional status and symptoms, but the optimal treatment regimen for these patients has not been thoroughly established. Many patients with SCC present with uncontrolled systemic disease and poor performance status, and are not eligible for standard surgical resection. They are generally treated with 3D conformal palliative RT (3DCRT) alone, however recent trials suggest that less than 70% of patients are ambulatory, that the re-establishment of ambulation in non-ambulatory patients is poor, and the duration of improvement is guarded with radiotherapy alone.

Recently, stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) used alone or after previous radiotherapy to treat spinal metastasis has demonstrated superior results in pain control, tumour response and durability. SBRT requires time for careful planning, and many patients with neurologic symptoms must be treated immediately to prevent progression. Therefore the role of SBRT is still unclear in this patient population, although it seems to be a potential alternative to surgical decompression in patient not suitable for surgery. The investigators propose a feasibility study to investigate the potential benefits of dose escalation with a sequential SBRT boost to urgent 3D CRT in the setting of SCC. This regimen will allow inoperable patients to receive urgent 3DCRT while simultaneously creating the opportunity for superior outcomes with SBRT. The investigators also aim to characterize the effect on motor function and ambulation, pain and QoL. This study could stimulate further multi-center randomized trials in this area, improve motor function and patient-reported QoL, and contribute to improving oncology care in Canada in a meaningful way.","[(0, 30, 'RADIOTHERAPY', 'Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy'), (32, 36, 'RADIOTHERAPY', 'SBRT'), (61, 86, 'RADIOTHERAPY', '3D Conformal Radiotherapy'), (107, 150, 'CONDITION', 'Metastatic Epidural Spinal Cord Compression'), (152, 155, 'CONDITION', 'SCC'), (188, 211, 'CONDITION', 'Spinal cord compression'), (213, 216, 'CONDITION', 'SCC'), (528, 531, 'CONDITION', 'SCC'), (690, 716, 'RADIOTHERAPY', '3D conformal palliative RT'), (718, 723, 'RADIOTHERAPY', '3DCRT'), (933, 945, 'RADIOTHERAPY', 'radiotherapy'), (964, 994, 'RADIOTHERAPY', 'stereotactic body radiotherapy'), (996, 1000, 'RADIOTHERAPY', 'SBRT'), (1031, 1043, 'RADIOTHERAPY', 'radiotherapy'), (1053, 1070, 'CONDITION', 'spinal metastasis'), (1108, 1112, 'CONDITION', 'pain'), (1122, 1128, 'CONDITION', 'tumour'), (1154, 1158, 'RADIOTHERAPY', 'SBRT'), (1312, 1316, 'RADIOTHERAPY', 'SBRT'), (1594, 1598, 'RADIOTHERAPY', 'SBRT'), (1615, 1621, 'RADIOTHERAPY', '3D CRT'), (1640, 1643, 'CONDITION', 'SCC'), (1707, 1712, 'RADIOTHERAPY', '3DCRT'), (1786, 1790, 'RADIOTHERAPY', 'SBRT'), (1880, 1884, 'CONDITION', 'pain')]","[(0, 30), (32, 36), (61, 86), (107, 150), (152, 155), (188, 211), (213, 216), (528, 531), (690, 716), (718, 723), (933, 945), (964, 994), (996, 1000), (1031, 1043), (1053, 1070), (1108, 1112), (1122, 1128), (1154, 1158), (1312, 1316), (1594, 1598), (1615, 1621), (1640, 1643), (1707, 1712), (1786, 1790), (1880, 1884)]","[(107, 150, 'CONDITION'), (152, 155, 'CONDITION'), (188, 211, 'CONDITION'), (213, 216, 'CONDITION'), (528, 531, 'CONDITION'), (1053, 1070, 'CONDITION'), (1108, 1112, 'CONDITION'), (1122, 1128, 'CONDITION'), (1640, 1643, 'CONDITION'), (1880, 1884, 'CONDITION')]","[(0, 30, 'RADIOTHERAPY'), (32, 36, 'RADIOTHERAPY'), (61, 86, 'RADIOTHERAPY'), (690, 716, 'RADIOTHERAPY'), (718, 723, 'RADIOTHERAPY'), (933, 945, 'RADIOTHERAPY'), (964, 994, 'RADIOTHERAPY'), (996, 1000, 'RADIOTHERAPY'), (1031, 1043, 'RADIOTHERAPY'), (1154, 1158, 'RADIOTHERAPY'), (1312, 1316, 'RADIOTHERAPY'), (1594, 1598, 'RADIOTHERAPY'), (1615, 1621, 'RADIOTHERAPY'), (1707, 1712, 'RADIOTHERAPY'), (1786, 1790, 'RADIOTHERAPY')]"

68,NCT02810392,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"Intranasal Insulin and Post-stroke Cognition: A Pilot Study | Almost two-thirds of survivors have cognitive impairment (CI), manifested as memory, language, and judgement problems. Post-stroke CI at 2 weeks is a significant predictor of long-term functional outcome, and more generally, cognitive impairments have a major impact on functional outcome and ability to participate in rehabilitation. CI is associated with increased systemic inflammation. Intranasally-administered insulin is a promising new therapy for enhancing memory in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), shown in multiple randomized controlled studies. Likely mechanisms of benefit are intranasal insulin's ability to restore normal cerebral insulin signaling. Based on the overlap in cerebral insulin resistance that occurs in both AD and post-stroke CI, we have designed an innovative proof-of-concept, feasibility trial designed to provide pilot data as to whether post-stroke survivor CI and caregiver burden is improved with intranasal insulin early after stroke. We will explore the impact of intranasal insulin on inflammatory biomarkers, since inflammation is a major underlying cause of CI, as shown by others and in our preliminary studies of VCAM-1. Specific Aims are: 1. Determine if patients with ischemic stroke randomized to intranasal insulin 20 IU BID for 3 weeks have improved cognition, compared to patients who receive intranasal saline. Primary outcome is a composite of (a) memory and executive function z scores. 2. To assess the impact of intranasal insulin vs saline on change in inflammatory biomarker levels (VCAM-1, TNF-alpha, TNFR-I and II) before and after the treatment period. 3. To measure differences in burden among caregivers of participants in the intranasal insulin vs intranasal saline groups. We will prospectively randomize 40 subjects to intranasal insulin (40 IU) vs saline treatment.

70,NCT03893214,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy for Acrophobia in a Single Session Design and the Role of Respiration for Fear Extinction | In recent years, in the treatment of phobias, exposure therapy in virtual reality is becoming more and more popular as an alternative for in-vivo exposure. Effectiveness of virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) is comparable to in-vivo exposure therapy, though several characteristics of the VRET have an impact on the outcome of the therapy (e.g., immersion into the virtual environment (VE), familiarity with the VE). Additionally, the use of VRET varies from multiple exposure sessions to single-session VRET. Single-session therapy has an economic advantage and in in-vivo, post therapy outcomes show good results. In virtual reality, the assessment of outcome post therapy and in follow-up of single-session therapies is still needed for an evaluation of this approach. As an outcome measure, behavioral assessments are especially relevant for effectiveness studies as in fear of heights it is closer to the individual's life to know how high they voluntarily go up a building than to have hypothetical self-report questionnaire results.

Much research has been conducted on physiological correlates of the subjective experience of fear in exposure therapy as they are assumed to be a prerequisite for effective exposure treatment. Skin conductance level (SCL) and heart rate can be used for objective manipulation checks of exposure therapy. SCL is found to increase during fearful situations independent of setting while heart rate only increases during in-vivo exposure. Contrary to heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV) is not thoroughly studied in VRET yet. HRV is associated with the adaptability of an organism to new environments and cognitive functioning. High Frequency HRV is found to be reduced in individuals with mental disorders, and positive and negative mood inductions lead to differential HRV responses overall.

Respiration is a well-studied correlate of emotional experience and especially of the experience of fear and anxiety. In a series of experiments, it was found that sighing is tightly associated with relief in or after fearful or stressful situations and might become maladaptive when used disproportionally often. This study shows that respiration parameters have an impact on the handling of fearful situations in a reciprocal way. On the one hand, fear leads to an increased respiration rate and sigh rate while on the other hand, an altered sigh rate or respiration rate might have an impact on the experience of fear and be used as a defensive reaction to a fearful situation. As such, specific respiration patterns might act as emotion-driven behaviors (EDB). EDBs are responses to emotions that result in a short-term reduction of a negative state while in long-term support the maintenance of the phobia.

The aim of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a single-session VRET for acrophobia with a multimethod outcome design. Familiarity of the setting will be high with the use of a well-known tower in this area. Immersion into the VE will be assessed with a presence questionnaire. For a manipulation check, physiological data will be assessed, i.e., SCL, heart rate and HRV. Primary outcome measure will be a behavioral approach test (BAT) as behavioral assessment. Additionally, after four weeks, a follow-up assessment will investigate the stability of the effectiveness of the VRET in comparison to a waitlist control group. A second aim of this study is to investigate the impact of respiration as an EDB on the effectiveness of an exposure therapy. Therefore, the association between respiration and outcome of the VRET will be analyzed.

Hypothesis 1: Participants in the VRET condition show less height avoidance in the BAT after the intervention than participants in the control condition.

Hypothesis 2: Participants in the VRET condition show less height avoidance in the BAT in a four-week follow-up assessment than participants in the control condition.

Hypothesis 3: Participants in the VRET condition score significantly lower on the Acrophobia Questionnaire at follow-up than participants in the control condition.

Hypothesis 4: During the VRET, breath holding is used as EDB. Participants that hold their breath, profit less from the VRET than participants that do not hold their breath.

Hypothesis 5: During the VRET, sighing is used as EDB. Participants that sigh, profit less from the VRET than participants that do not sigh.","[(0, 32, 'OTHER', 'Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy'), (37, 47, 'CONDITION', 'Acrophobia'), (162, 169, 'CONDITION', 'phobias'), (298, 330, 'OTHER', 'virtual reality exposure therapy'), (332, 336, 'OTHER', 'VRET'), (419, 423, 'OTHER', 'VRET'), (572, 576, 'OTHER', 'VRET'), (634, 638, 'OTHER', 'VRET'), (1004, 1019, 'CONDITION', 'fear of heights'), (1688, 1692, 'OTHER', 'VRET'), (2871, 2877, 'CONDITION', 'phobia'), (2954, 2958, 'OTHER', 'VRET'), (2963, 2973, 'CONDITION', 'acrophobia'), (3467, 3471, 'OTHER', 'VRET'), (3491, 3499, 'CONTROL', 'waitlist'), (3707, 3711, 'OTHER', 'VRET'), (3765, 3769, 'OTHER', 'VRET'), (3790, 3806, 'CONDITION', 'height avoidance'), (3920, 3924, 'OTHER', 'VRET'), (3945, 3961, 'CONDITION', 'height avoidance'), (4088, 4092, 'OTHER', 'VRET'), (4136, 4146, 'CONDITION', 'Acrophobia'), (4244, 4248, 'OTHER', 'VRET'), (4339, 4343, 'OTHER', 'VRET'), (4419, 4423, 'OTHER', 'VRET'), (4494, 4498, 'OTHER', 'VRET')]","[(0, 32), (37, 47), (162, 169), (298, 330), (332, 336), (419, 423), (572, 576), (634, 638), (1004, 1019), (1688, 1692), (2871, 2877), (2954, 2958), (2963, 2973), (3467, 3471), (3491, 3499), (3707, 3711), (3765, 3769), (3790, 3806), (3920, 3924), (3945, 3961), (4088, 4092), (4136, 4146), (4244, 4248), (4339, 4343), (4419, 4423), (4494, 4498)]","[(37, 47, 'CONDITION'), (162, 169, 'CONDITION'), (1004, 1019, 'CONDITION'), (2871, 2877, 'CONDITION'), (2963, 2973, 'CONDITION'), (3790, 3806, 'CONDITION'), (3945, 3961, 'CONDITION'), (4136, 4146, 'CONDITION')]","[(0, 32, 'OTHER'), (298, 330, 'OTHER'), (332, 336, 'OTHER'), (419, 423, 'OTHER'), (572, 576, 'OTHER'), (634, 638, 'OTHER'), (1688, 1692, 'OTHER'), (2954, 2958, 'OTHER'), (3467, 3471, 'OTHER'), (3491, 3499, 'CONTROL'), (3707, 3711, 'OTHER'), (3765, 3769, 'OTHER'), (3920, 3924, 'OTHER'), (4088, 4092, 'OTHER'), (4244, 4248, 'OTHER'), (4339, 4343, 'OTHER'), (4419, 4423, 'OTHER'), (4494, 4498, 'OTHER')]"

In the proposed study, we will investigate these mechanistic hypotheses in cognitively normal elderly by examining the longitudinal associations between SDB and cognitive decline, novel MR neuroimaging and CSF biomarkers for neurodegeneration; while our secondary goal is to launch a pilot treatment study to aid in interpreting the mechanistic hypotheses and to examine the effects of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on cognitive decline and neurodegeneration.","[(26, 45, 'CONDITION', ""Alzheimer's Disease""), (127, 153, 'CONDITION', 'Sleep Disordered Breathing'), (155, 158, 'CONDITION', 'SDB'), (363, 377, 'CONDITION', 'memory decline'), (442, 450, 'CONDITION', 'dementia'), (516, 535, 'CONDITION', ""Alzheimer's disease""), (537, 539, 'CONDITION', 'AD'), (562, 565, 'CONDITION', 'SDB'), (603, 606, 'CONDITION', 'SDB'), (633, 635, 'CONDITION', 'AD'), (808, 811, 'CONDITION', 'SDB'), (1047, 1082, 'OTHER', 'continuous positive airway pressure'), (1084, 1088, 'OTHER', 'CPAP'), (1093, 1110, 'CONDITION', 'cognitive decline')]","[(26, 45), (127, 153), (155, 158), (363, 377), (442, 450), (516, 535), (537, 539), (562, 565), (603, 606), (633, 635), (808, 811), (1047, 1082), (1084, 1088), (1093, 1110)]","[(26, 45, 'CONDITION'), (127, 153, 'CONDITION'), (155, 158, 'CONDITION'), (363, 377, 'CONDITION'), (442, 450, 'CONDITION'), (516, 535, 'CONDITION'), (537, 539, 'CONDITION'), (562, 565, 'CONDITION'), (603, 606, 'CONDITION'), (633, 635, 'CONDITION'), (808, 811, 'CONDITION'), (1093, 1110, 'CONDITION')]","[(1047, 1082, 'OTHER'), (1084, 1088, 'OTHER')]"

Known as the carpal tunnel, this canal contains the wrist bones, transverse carpal ligament, median nerve, and digital flexor tendons. Edema, tendon inflammation, hormonal changes, and manual activity can contribute to increased nerve compression and sometimes cause pain.

In the system that will be presented via computer and hand motion sensor, the patient will be asked to perform therapeutic exercises for the diagnosis of CTS in a scenario developed through virtual reality. The investigators predict that patients will actively participate in virtual reality-mediated therapeutic exercise program with high motivation and their functional results will be better than classical exercise programs.

97,NCT04976725,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"Comparison of the Effectiveness of Craniosacral Therapy and Myofacial Relaxation Techniques in People Diagnosed With Migraine | Headache is a neurological condition that is very common all over the world and is observed at some time in life in more than 90% of society. Migraine headache, known for thousands of years, is one of the oldest diseases of humanity. The word 'hemicrania', meaning 'half of a head', is used due to unilateral pain. Approaches to treating migraine include medication, relaxation, biofeedback, living a regular life, adequate sleep, exercise, and stress management. Neck pain is especially common in migraine patients. Exercise, manual practices, electrop novelties are used to reduce musculoskeletal problems, thus reducing the effects of migraine. Myofascial relaxation techniques, which are included in the manipulative techniques in the literature, are relaxation methods performed on myofascial trigger points.Osteopathic manual therapy (OMT) , which has recently entered the literature, 19. osteopathy, developed by Andrew Taylor STILL at the end of the century, is a treatment system characterized by focusing on integrity and using it by hand to heal diseases.The study of cranial OMM kraniyum first anatomical and physiological mechanisms for the prevention and treatment of disease as a whole is concerned with the relationship of the body, including diagnostic and therapeutic methods.It is used in the treatment of somatic dysfunction of the head and other body parts. An important component of cranial Omm is the primary respiratory mechanism, which occurs as movement of the head bones, sacrum, dural membranes, central nervous system and cerebrospinal fluid. The primary respiratory mechanism is synchronous with the cranial rhythmic impulse, a 2-phase rhythmic cycle that represents a dynamic metabolic exchange with each stage of the body. This cycle is indicated as loops between 7 and 14 per minute.Fascial mobilization therapy increases energy use in segments implemented by mechanical changes.Accordingly, it helps to reduce the spasm of these layers extending fascially, to dissolve adhesions, and to increase the range of motion of the joint.

General aims

To analyse the immediate therapeutic effect of the DNHS technique and the effect at 15 days follow-up, for the following variables:

Spasticity
Muscle stiffness
Upper limb function
Patient perceived quality of life

Materials and methods Population: patients from the province of Zaragoza (Spain) diagnosed with a haemorrhagic or ischemic CVA by a neurologist.

Recruitment strategy: recruitment will take place via the Stroke Association in Aragon (AIDA) [Aragon Stroke Association] in the province of Zaragoza, Spain, seeing as the greater proportion of patients who have suffered a stroke and are in the chronic stage of the illness go to this centre to receive treatment.

Furthermore, in the case of patients who wish to participate in the study after having received information via third persons or via other means and who are not members of the Association or do not attend the centre on a regular basis, the Association AIDA has offered to allow these people to attend for free, making its facilities available and supporting the development of this study.","[(17, 29, 'OTHER', 'Dry Needling'), (31, 45, 'OTHER', 'DNHS Technique'), (64, 78, 'CONDITION', 'Chronic Stroke'), (104, 108, 'OTHER', 'DNHS'), (149, 195, 'OTHER', 'deep dry needling of myofascial trigger points'), (392, 402, 'CONDITION', 'spasticity'), (407, 423, 'CONDITION', 'muscle stiffness'), (457, 467, 'CONDITION', 'hypertonia'), (571, 605, 'CONDITION', 'chronic cerebral vascular accident'), (607, 610, 'CONDITION', 'CVA'), (730, 734, 'OTHER', 'DNHS'), (812, 822, 'CONDITION', 'Spasticity'), (823, 839, 'CONDITION', 'Muscle stiffness'), (1018, 1021, 'CONDITION', 'CVA'), (1264, 1270, 'CONDITION', 'stroke')]","[(17, 29), (31, 45), (64, 78), (104, 108), (149, 195), (392, 402), (407, 423), (457, 467), (571, 605), (607, 610), (730, 734), (812, 822), (823, 839), (1018, 1021), (1264, 1270)]","[(64, 78, 'CONDITION'), (392, 402, 'CONDITION'), (407, 423, 'CONDITION'), (457, 467, 'CONDITION'), (571, 605, 'CONDITION'), (607, 610, 'CONDITION'), (812, 822, 'CONDITION'), (823, 839, 'CONDITION'), (1018, 1021, 'CONDITION'), (1264, 1270, 'CONDITION')]","[(17, 29, 'OTHER'), (31, 45, 'OTHER'), (104, 108, 'OTHER'), (149, 195, 'OTHER'), (730, 734, 'OTHER')]"

It is caused by a mutation in the gene for dystrophin, a protein that is important for maintaining normal muscle structure and function. Loss of dystrophin causes muscle fragility that leads to weakness and loss of walking ability. A specific type of mutation, called a nonsense (premature stop codon) mutation is the cause of dystrophinopathy in approximately 10-15 percent (%) of boys with the disease. Ataluren is an orally delivered, investigational drug that has the potential to overcome the effects of the nonsense mutation. The main goal of this Phase 3 study is to evaluate the effect of ataluren on walking ability.

113,NCT04481217,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"The Mediating Role of Dissociative Symptoms and Early Maladaptive Schemas in the Relationship Between Childhood Trauma and Auditory Hallucinations in Schizophrenia | BACKGROUND It is demonstrated that strong associations between trauma suffered in childhood and having schizophrenia, and more specifically to experience acoustic-verbal hallucinations (AVH). A second generation of research is currently examining the cognitive and affective processes likely to play a mediating role in this association. These mediators appear to include early maladaptive personality patterns and dissociative experiences. Although these factors have most often been explored separately, recent research indicates that they could be associated, and thus contribute to AVH. More specifically, another study has shown that the association between childhood trauma and predisposition to AVH is not direct but depends on cognitive factors including the impact of violence suffered during childhood on early maladaptive schemas and dissociation. However, this study was carried out on a non-clinical sample of subjects with a predisposition to AVH.

OBJECTIVES: testing a structural model of AVH, childhood trauma, early maladaptive schemas and dissociative symptoms in large multicentric sample of inpatients diagnosed with schizophrenia and AVH (n=350). Secondary objectives are (i) test in the model the role of all the early patterns described by Jeffrey Young instead of targeting only the schemes that are part of the model tested in previous study as the one by Bortolon and colleagues, (ii) compare the quality of the adjustment of the confirmatory model to the quality of the adjustment of the exploratory model.

METHODS: one single visit in which subjects will receive self-reported questionnaires (Childhood trauma questionnaire, The Young schema questionnaire short form, Dissociative experiences scale, Launay-Slade hallucination scale and Cardiff Anomalous Perceptions Scale.

ANALYSES: Structural equation model performed additional analysis using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling. The primary endpoint corresponds to significant associations between the variables. The quality of the model will be assessed using a fit quality measure. The secondary endpoints are significant associations between the different variables (p <0.05) and the model quality assessed with a quality measure of the fit.

Pathophysiologically, increased pharyngeal collapsibility is a major endotype of the disease and the investigators have shown that this surgery can improve pharyngeal compliance. The development of approaches to treat pharyngeal hypotonia by maxillofacial rehabilitation supports the treatment of this endotype. A study in adults showed a benefit from playing the didgeridoo, a wind instrument, for 3 months, without pathophysiological explanation. The investigators hypothesise that playing this instrument improves pharyngeal compliance (re-education effect) in a similar way to the effect observed after otorhinolaryngology surgery.

121,NCT01046370,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"A Pilot Study of Amygdala Retraining Program (ARP) Versus Control (C) in Patients With Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), Chronic Fatigue (CF) and Fibromyalgia (FM) | The purpose of this pilot study is to gather preliminary data on the efficacy and feasibility of the Amygdala Retraining Program (ARP), a mind-body practice versus a control (C) on fatigue, quality of life and sleep in patients with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), Chronic Fatigue (CF) and Fibromyalgia (FM).

CFS, CF and FM are incapacitating disorders characterized by profound fatigue, muscle pain, impaired memory, insomnia, and post-exertional malaise (Fukuda 1994). Current literature points to a centrally sensitized state in CFS, CF and FM (Meeus 2007). The ARP attempts to retrain this neuronal network through mind-body practices such as cognitive restructuring via neurolinguistic programming, yoga based breathing and simple mindfulness based meditation. A case series of 33 patients with CFS and ARP reported improvement in 92% of patients with two-thirds of patients reaching 80-100% of pre-illness levels of health (Gupta 2009). However ARP has never been formally studied in CFS.

We propose to gather preliminary data on the efficacy and feasibility of ARP versus C on fatigue, quality of life and sleep in 30 patients with CFS, CF and FM. All participants will undergo standard clinical treatment which consist of a 2 day self-management program in the Chronic Fatigue Clinic. Following this, participants will be randomized into the ARP or C group. The ARP group will receive an additional 2.5 hour training surrounding core concepts of the ARP program. They will then be given the ARP DVD program and booklet, to reinforce and continue the practice. They will then receive scheduled bi-monthly phone calls for 3 months from a study investigator for support. The C group will receive only standard care. However they will receive a complementary copy of the ARP program at the end of the study (6 month time point) as a gift for participation in the study.

Preliminary data on efficacy will be assessed at baseline, 1, 3 and 6 months using the following validated questionnaires: Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MDFI), Short form-36 (SF36) Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), Epworth Sleep Scale (ESS) and Measure Your Medical Outcome Profile (MYMOP-2). Feasibility will be assessed by evaluation of a daily practice log where patients record the total time spent daily in the practice of ARP and any specific difficulties they encountered in the practice of the program.","[(17, 44, 'BEHAVIOURAL', 'Amygdala Retraining Program'), (46, 49, 'BEHAVIOURAL', 'ARP'), (58, 65, 'CONTROL', 'Control'), (87, 111, 'CONDITION', 'Chronic Fatigue Syndrome'), (113, 116, 'CONDITION', 'CFS'), (119, 134, 'CONDITION', 'Chronic Fatigue'), (136, 138, 'CONDITION', 'CF'), (144, 156, 'CONDITION', 'Fibromyalgia'), (158, 160, 'CONDITION', 'FM'), (265, 292, 'BEHAVIOURAL', 'Amygdala Retraining Program'), (294, 297, 'BEHAVIOURAL', 'ARP'), (330, 337, 'CONTROL', 'control'), (345, 352, 'CONDITION', 'fatigue'), (397, 421, 'CONDITION', 'Chronic Fatigue Syndrome'), (423, 426, 'CONDITION', 'CFS'), (429, 444, 'CONDITION', 'Chronic Fatigue'), (446, 448, 'CONDITION', 'CF'), (454, 466, 'CONDITION', 'Fibromyalgia'), (468, 470, 'CONDITION', 'FM'), (474, 477, 'CONDITION', 'CFS'), (479, 481, 'CONDITION', 'CF'), (486, 488, 'CONDITION', 'FM'), (544, 551, 'CONDITION', 'fatigue'), (553, 564, 'CONDITION', 'muscle pain'), (566, 581, 'CONDITION', 'impaired memory'), (583, 591, 'CONDITION', 'insomnia'), (697, 700, 'CONDITION', 'CFS'), (702, 704, 'CONDITION', 'CF'), (709, 711, 'CONDITION', 'FM'), (730, 733, 'BEHAVIOURAL', 'ARP'), (965, 968, 'CONDITION', 'CFS'), (973, 976, 'BEHAVIOURAL', 'ARP'), (1116, 1119, 'BEHAVIOURAL', 'ARP'), (1155, 1158, 'CONDITION', 'CFS'), (1234, 1237, 'BEHAVIOURAL', 'ARP'), (1250, 1257, 'CONDITION', 'fatigue'), (1305, 1308, 'CONDITION', 'CFS'), (1310, 1312, 'CONDITION', 'CF'), (1317, 1319, 'CONDITION', 'FM'), (1398, 1427, 'BEHAVIOURAL', '2 day self-management program'), (1435, 1450, 'CONDITION', 'Chronic Fatigue'), (1516, 1519, 'BEHAVIOURAL', 'ARP'), (1536, 1539, 'BEHAVIOURAL', 'ARP'), (1624, 1635, 'BEHAVIOURAL', 'ARP program'), (1665, 1680, 'BEHAVIOURAL', 'ARP DVD program'), (1872, 1885, 'CONTROL', 'standard care'), (1941, 1952, 'BEHAVIOURAL', 'ARP program'), (2482, 2485, 'BEHAVIOURAL', 'ARP')]","[(17, 44), (46, 49), (58, 65), (87, 111), (113, 116), (119, 134), (136, 138), (144, 156), (158, 160), (265, 292), (294, 297), (330, 337), (345, 352), (397, 421), (423, 426), (429, 444), (446, 448), (454, 466), (468, 470), (474, 477), (479, 481), (486, 488), (544, 551), (553, 564), (566, 581), (583, 591), (697, 700), (702, 704), (709, 711), (730, 733), (965, 968), (973, 976), (1116, 1119), (1155, 1158), (1234, 1237), (1250, 1257), (1305, 1308), (1310, 1312), (1317, 1319), (1398, 1427), (1435, 1450), (1516, 1519), (1536, 1539), (1624, 1635), (1665, 1680), (1872, 1885), (1941, 1952), (2482, 2485)]","[(87, 111, 'CONDITION'), (113, 116, 'CONDITION'), (119, 134, 'CONDITION'), (136, 138, 'CONDITION'), (144, 156, 'CONDITION'), (158, 160, 'CONDITION'), (345, 352, 'CONDITION'), (397, 421, 'CONDITION'), (423, 426, 'CONDITION'), (429, 444, 'CONDITION'), (446, 448, 'CONDITION'), (454, 466, 'CONDITION'), (468, 470, 'CONDITION'), (474, 477, 'CONDITION'), (479, 481, 'CONDITION'), (486, 488, 'CONDITION'), (544, 551, 'CONDITION'), (553, 564, 'CONDITION'), (566, 581, 'CONDITION'), (583, 591, 'CONDITION'), (697, 700, 'CONDITION'), (702, 704, 'CONDITION'), (709, 711, 'CONDITION'), (965, 968, 'CONDITION'), (1155, 1158, 'CONDITION'), (1250, 1257, 'CONDITION'), (1305, 1308, 'CONDITION'), (1310, 1312, 'CONDITION'), (1317, 1319, 'CONDITION'), (1435, 1450, 'CONDITION')]","[(17, 44, 'BEHAVIOURAL'), (46, 49, 'BEHAVIOURAL'), (58, 65, 'CONTROL'), (265, 292, 'BEHAVIOURAL'), (294, 297, 'BEHAVIOURAL'), (330, 337, 'CONTROL'), (730, 733, 'BEHAVIOURAL'), (973, 976, 'BEHAVIOURAL'), (1116, 1119, 'BEHAVIOURAL'), (1234, 1237, 'BEHAVIOURAL'), (1398, 1427, 'BEHAVIOURAL'), (1516, 1519, 'BEHAVIOURAL'), (1536, 1539, 'BEHAVIOURAL'), (1624, 1635, 'BEHAVIOURAL'), (1665, 1680, 'BEHAVIOURAL'), (1872, 1885, 'CONTROL'), (1941, 1952, 'BEHAVIOURAL'), (2482, 2485, 'BEHAVIOURAL')]"

124,NCT04354298,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"Effects of Improvisational Dance on Cognition and Daily Function Among People With Parkinson Disease | The long-term goal of this work is to maintain or improve daily function of people with PD by addressing cognition. The overall objective is to discover interventions that aid in cognitive functioning. The central hypothesis is that engagement in an improvisational dance (ID) class will benefit cognition among people with PD. Improvisational dance involves spontaneously generated movement, similar to how one moves in everyday life. The literature shows that ID classes positively impact motor impairments associated with PD, such as balance, gait, and functional mobility. Along with being physically demanding, ID requires the use and coordination of a number of cognitive capacities to properly execute movements. This type of activity challenges, and thus may strengthen, cognitive processes such as motor planning, decision making, flexible thinking, initiation, and execution, which may give people cognitive based strategies to be utilized in various aspects of daily life. By improving motor function and/or cognition, ID may also contribute to improved daily functioning, or the ability to perform and participate in daily activities. Despite these theoretical links, evidence for the effect of ID on cognition and overall daily function is limited. The current project objective is to address this gap and better understand the effects of ID for people with PD. Specifically, it will test the effect of IMPROVment®, a method of ID designed for people with PD, on cognition and daily function.

Participants' cognition will be assessed at baseline (T1) using the NIH Toolbox Cognitive Battery, the Alternate Uses Task, and the Weekly Calendar Planning Activity. Global cognition will be assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. They then will be randomly assigned to either the immediate intervention (ID) or waitlist-control (WC) group. The ID group will start the 12-week IMPROVment® intervention, which consists of weekly ID classes that progress according to a standardized method while the WC group will receive no intervention and continue with their regular daily routine and activity level. After 12 weeks, both groups will complete cognitive testing again (T2). Cognitive test scores will be compared across time points and between groups using a mixed model repeated measures ANOVA. The investigators hypothesize that IMPROVment® will have positive effects on the cognitive abilities of people with PD. Participants will also complete two questionnaires to assess daily function at T1 and T2: Older Americans Resources and Services Scale- Extended Version and PROMIS Satisfaction with Participation in Discretionary Social Activities. These scores will be compared similar to the above aim. The investigators hypothesize that IMPROVment® will have positive effects on daily function in people with PD.

Participant mood will be assessed in two different ways. The first being to investigate the immediate effect of participating in an IMPROVment® class on mood, fatigue, and anxiety. The investigators hypothesize that mood will positively improve from pre to post of each class. To assess this, participants will respond to a scale assessing mood, specifically sadness, nervousness, energy, and overall well-being before and after each class every week. The second measurement is to investigate the effect of IMPROVment® on anxiety, fatigue, and depression. The investigators hypothesize that IMPROVment® class will decrease feelings of depression for those with PD.

The therapy is intended to reverse the loss of motor and sensory function.

Following non-CNS tissue injury, macrophages quickly arrive on the scene, where they clean up cell debris, secrete different molecules thus promoting a controlled inflammatory reaction that forms the first phase of the wound healing process. While this process occurs in most tissues, including peripheral nerves, it does not occur in the CNS, where macrophages and other immune cells are relatively rare, and their activities curtailed by a biochemical mechanism known as ""immune privilege.""

In animal studies, it appears that incubated macrophages circumvent the immune privilege, thus supporting the regrowth of axons through the injury site and enabling the recovery of neurological function.

135,NCT01590745,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"A Randomised Controlled Double Blind Trial Of Therapeutic Ultrasound in Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) | Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) is a recognisable pattern of symptoms and signs, which are caused by compression of the median (middle) nerve as it passes through the carpal tunnel at the wrist.

This condition affects individuals by causing pain, numbness, tingling sensations and sometimes weakness in the fingers and may extend to shoulder and neck areas. The cause for most cases is unknown (idiopathic) though some common conditions are associated with an increased incidence, including obesity, pregnancy, hypothyroidism, arthritis, diabetes, and trauma.

Diagnosis is primarily clinical and the condition is easily recognised from the characteristic symptoms in straightforward cases but diagnostic support is provided by investigations such as nerve conduction studies and ultrasound imaging.

Treatment may include splinting, local steroid injection at wrist, activity modification,physical or occupational therapy (controversial), medications, and surgery. Treatment with local therapeutic ultrasound has been suggested to be effective but existing trials are inconclusive.

Wrist splinting is only partially effective with a success rate of 34%, Steroid injection is followed by frequent relapses and there remains uncertainty about the safety of serial injections. Surgery is effective but has a small but significant incidence of permanent complications. Any demonstrably effective and safe addition to the therapeutic options would be a significant advance in treatment. Therapeutic ultrasound at present appears a promising option, having a very good safety record but so far uncertain evidence of efficacy.

In our trial patients, with mild carpal tunnel syndrome, confirmed by nerve conduction studies, will all be given wrist splints so that no patients will be left untreated. They will be randomly allocated to either therapeutic or sham ultrasound therapy (20 sessions over 7 weeks) and followed up for 1year. The patients, operators of the ultrasound equipment and assessors will all be blind to treatment allocation.

The effect of treatment on symptoms will be assessed using a validated questionnaire and nerve conduction studies will be repeated at completion of the ultrasound treatment, 6 and 12 months.

It can be triggered when experiencing virtual reality (VR), and it affects approximately 20% to 80% of individuals who use these resources. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms of CS are not fully understood and the use of virtual environments that have become increasingly recurrent in several sectors deserves attention, as VR is becoming commonplace in methods and techniques of assessment, diagnosis and treatment. Objective: to analyze cortical electrophysiological activity using electroencephalography (EEGq) in individuals with SC, under the influence of different audiovisual conditions. Methodology: The study is a double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial, the sample for survey satisfaction N= 42 participants, the public were university students from the Universidade Federal do Delta Parnaíba (UFDPar) of both sexes, aged between 18 to 28 years, those who agreed, underwent screening, those who met the criteria and fit, were randomized and allocated to one each of 02 conditions, (C1 - video only) and (C2 - associated with binaural audio), three times in each condition, with a duration of 10 minutes of immersion, with evaluation (pre) before (post) with QEEG and Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ), exposure to virtual content was on regular alternate days, with a 24-hour interval between each virtual exposure, at the end of each condition, there will be a 14-day washout and crossover between the conditions, and after the last intervention, there will be a 7-day follow-up and reassessment with qEEG and SSQ.

It is known that physical exercise increases insulin sensitivity in healthy subjects. Wether stroke patients can increase insulin sensitivity via physical exercise is not known.

Chronic low-grade inflammation is associated with an increased risk of stroke. Physical exercise has shown to increase IL-6 directly after exercise in untrained subjects. When fitness is increased in each subject then the peak IL-6 concentration after exercise decreases and so does the basal level of IL-6. It is not known whether stroke patients can increase physical activity level to a degree where chronic inflammation are decreased.

This study is designed to evaluate if physical exercise after stroke will increases insulin sensitivity and reduce low-grade chronic inflammation.

Stroke patients have been randomized to intervention with physical exercise or control in the ExStroke pilot trial and followed for 2 years.

The strength training regimen itself, while ultimately having beneficial effects, causes muscle fibers to be damaged, which the body has to recover from. As the body recovers, it rebuilds the muscle tissue and after multiple consecutive bouts of strength training, the muscle eventually becomes larger and stronger. Thus, it is the recovery from strength training exercise that ultimately determines how well the body adapts. Where inadequate recovery could eventually lead to overtraining and/or injury, optimizing the recovery process from strength training could maximize strength training adaptations. This concept of optimizing recovery has led to development of many supplements, including antioxidants, which may reduce the damage associated with strength training activities and therefore enhance positive adaptations.

Autoimmune means the body makes antibodies that attack its own cells and tissues. These types of antibodies are also known as autoantibodies. People with generalized myasthenia gravis have a weakness in many muscles.

TAK-079 is a medicine to help people with generalized myasthenia gravis.

The main aim of this study is to check if people with generalized myasthenia gravis have side effects from 2 doses of TAK-079. Other aims are to learn if TAK-079 improves their clinical condition and lowers their autoantibody levels.

At the first visit, the study doctor will check if each person can take part. For those who can take part, participants will continue with their standard medicines for this condition during the study. Each participant will have a check-up by the study doctor.

Then, the participants will have 1 of 3 treatments:

A low dose of TAK-079.
A high dose of TAK-079.
A placebo. In this study, a placebo looks like TAK-079 but does not have any medicine in it.

Participants will not know which treatment they received, nor will their study doctors. This is to help make sure the results are more reliable.

For each treatment, participants will receive injections just under the skin, once a week for 8 weeks. The study doctors will check for side effects from the study treatments. The study doctors can stop or delay the injections in each participant if needed.

181,NCT05314348,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"Exploring the Electro-mechanical Coupling of Fasciculations in Motor Neuron Disease Using Surface Electromyography and Ultrasound: a Feasibility Study | Patients with motor neurone disease typically experience relentless motor decline and die within three years of symptom onset from respiratory muscle weakness. There are currently no effective therapies and the discovery of novel therapies is hampered by the lack of a sensitive disease biomarker. Consequently, there is a huge drive to discover novel biomarkers, which can reliably track disease progression over time. These can then be incorporated into clinical drug trials to expedite effective drug discovery.

Muscle fasciculations represent the hyperexcitability of diseased motor neurons and are almost universally present from the early stages of MND. We predict that the site, frequency and shape of fasciculations might provide a sensitive measure of disease progression in an individual.

We have been conducting a 12-month longitudinal study of 25 patients, performing high-density surface EMG every two months. We have validated an automated technique to process these large data sets. Ultrasound is widely used in clinical medicine to assess anatomical structure in a safe and non-invasive way. Dr Emma Hodson-Tole (Manchester Metropolitan University) and her group have been applying this to the analysis of fasciculations in healthy individuals and patients with MND.

This collaborative project will explore combining these two techniques simultaneously in patients with motor neuron disease and control subjects. The goal is to explore the nature of electro-mechanical coupling related to fasciculations and to determine whether any of these properties are pathophysiological. This would complement other studies from our two groups, investigating the natural history and potential utility of fasciculations as a biomarker of motor neuron health in MND.","[(63, 83, 'CONDITION', 'Motor Neuron Disease'), (167, 188, 'CONDITION', 'motor neurone disease'), (809, 812, 'CONDITION', 'MND'), (1433, 1436, 'CONDITION', 'MND'), (1542, 1562, 'CONDITION', 'motor neuron disease'), (1921, 1924, 'CONDITION', 'MND')]","[(63, 83), (167, 188), (809, 812), (1433, 1436), (1542, 1562), (1921, 1924)]","[(63, 83, 'CONDITION'), (167, 188, 'CONDITION'), (809, 812, 'CONDITION'), (1433, 1436, 'CONDITION'), (1542, 1562, 'CONDITION'), (1921, 1924, 'CONDITION')]",[]

183,NCT04424810,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"Effect of High-quality Pre-operative Videos on Patient Anxiety Levels Prior to Ambulatory Hand Surgery | Previous research has shown that YouTube is a poor source of high-quality medical information. This is likely because there is no regulation of the content on YouTube and relatively little of the content is posted by qualified medical professionals. It is known that up to 30% of patients use the internet to research the procedure they will be having and given the increasing popularity of YouTube we suspect many patients are using YouTube or similar sites as a source of information prior to elective surgery. There are likely a number of patient factors that contribute to patients seeking out videos as a source of pre-operative medical information. Patient age, which is generally inversely correlated to computer literacy, may have a role. Patient anxiety and pre-operative worrying may cause a patient to turn to the internet to search for information, and the poor overall quality of the content available may worsen pre-operative anxiety.

The primary objective of this study is to determine if providing patients with a reliable, high-quality video about their condition and operation prior to surgery reduces pre-operative anxiety. Secondary aims are to determine the percentage of patients that independently seek out videos online as a source of medical information prior to elective hand surgery, identify patient attributes that are associated with this behavior, and understand if introducing high quality pre-surgical videos has an impact on post-operative patient outcomes and/or patient engagement. The investigators hypothesize that providing patients with high-quality pre-operative videos will reduce pre-operative anxiety. Its is also expected that patients who seek out videos on their own for pre-operative medical information will be younger and have higher anxiety levels and pain catastrophizing scores. Additionally, the investigators hypothesize that patients who watch high-quality pre-operative videos may have better short term post-operative outcomes and greater engagement in their care than their counterparts that did not watch videos or who sought out videos on their own.","[(10, 43, 'OTHER', 'High-quality Pre-operative Videos'), (55, 62, 'CONDITION', 'Anxiety'), (90, 102, 'CONDITION', 'Hand Surgery'), (860, 867, 'CONDITION', 'anxiety'), (1045, 1052, 'CONDITION', 'anxiety'), (1136, 1164, 'OTHER', 'reliable, high-quality video'), (1240, 1247, 'CONDITION', 'anxiety'), (1515, 1547, 'OTHER', 'high quality pre-surgical videos'), (1683, 1716, 'OTHER', 'high-quality pre-operative videos'), (1743, 1750, 'CONDITION', 'anxiety'), (1890, 1897, 'CONDITION', 'anxiety'), (2006, 2039, 'OTHER', 'high-quality pre-operative videos'), (2161, 2177, 'CONTROL', 'not watch videos'), (2196, 2215, 'CONTROL', 'videos on their own')]","[(10, 43), (55, 62), (90, 102), (860, 867), (1045, 1052), (1136, 1164), (1240, 1247), (1515, 1547), (1683, 1716), (1743, 1750), (1890, 1897), (2006, 2039), (2161, 2177), (2196, 2215)]","[(55, 62, 'CONDITION'), (90, 102, 'CONDITION'), (860, 867, 'CONDITION'), (1045, 1052, 'CONDITION'), (1240, 1247, 'CONDITION'), (1743, 1750, 'CONDITION'), (1890, 1897, 'CONDITION')]","[(10, 43, 'OTHER'), (1136, 1164, 'OTHER'), (1515, 1547, 'OTHER'), (1683, 1716, 'OTHER'), (2006, 2039, 'OTHER'), (2161, 2177, 'CONTROL'), (2196, 2215, 'CONTROL')]"

187,NCT05253079,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"Erector Spinae Plane Block Versus Subcostal Transversus Abdominis Plane Block in Patients Undergoing Open Liver Resection Surgery: A Randomized Controlled Trial | Liver resection surgery is a common surgical procedure which is performed on patients with benign, malignant or metastatic hepatic tumor as well as for living liver donor. Liver resection surgery is usually performed through either right subcostal or inversed L-shaped incision; both approaches are associated with a significant postoperative pain which requires intensive analgesic plan to facilitate early mobilization and minimize complications.

There are various lines for pain management in liver resection surgery such as systemic analgesic drugs, neuraxial blocks (e.g., thoracic epidural analgesia) and transversus abdominis plane [TAP] block).

Systemic analgesic drugs are nearly constantly used in liver resection. However, being systemically administered, these drugs have many side effects on many organs and cannot totally eliminate postoperative pain. Thoracic epidural block is commonly associated with hypotension; furthermore, its use has other limitations such as delaying postoperative mobilization and possible hematoma and cord compression in patients with coagulopathy which is expected following liver resection. Therefore, there had been an increased interest in the use of abdominal field blocks to avoid disadvantages of neuraxial blocks and minimize the use of parenteral analgesic drugs.

TAP block is one of the classic field blocks which is extensively used in laparotomies including liver resection. However, the lack of visceral pain control TAP block influences the quality of its analgesic effect in this type of patients. Nevertheless, TAP block, namely the subcostal approach, is still the recommended field block in the latest procedure-specific recommendations for pain management in liver resection as it is the only block which showed good evidence.

In recent years, there has been increased interest in a newer field block, the erector spinae plane block (ESPB), due its easy performance and the possible coverage of visceral pain in addition to the somatic pain. ESPB showed promising results in liver resection surgery. ESBP was superior to TAP block in various abdominal surgeries. However, its analgesic efficacy had not been previously compared in relation to TAP in patients undergoing open liver resection surgery.","[(0, 26, 'OTHER', 'Erector Spinae Plane Block'), (34, 77, 'OTHER', 'Subcostal Transversus Abdominis Plane Block'), (101, 121, 'CONDITION', 'Open Liver Resection'), (163, 186, 'CONDITION', 'Liver resection surgery'), (254, 299, 'CONDITION', 'benign, malignant or metastatic hepatic tumor'), (335, 358, 'CONDITION', 'Liver resection surgery'), (492, 510, 'CONDITION', 'postoperative pain'), (641, 645, 'CONDITION', 'pain'), (660, 683, 'CONDITION', 'liver resection surgery'), (775, 814, 'OTHER', 'transversus abdominis plane [TAP] block'), (873, 888, 'CONDITION', 'liver resection'), (1284, 1299, 'CONDITION', 'liver resection'), (1482, 1491, 'OTHER', 'TAP block'), (1579, 1594, 'CONDITION', 'liver resection'), (1617, 1630, 'CONDITION', 'visceral pain'), (1639, 1648, 'OTHER', 'TAP block'), (1736, 1745, 'OTHER', 'TAP block'), (1887, 1902, 'CONDITION', 'liver resection'), (2035, 2061, 'OTHER', 'erector spinae plane block'), (2063, 2067, 'OTHER', 'ESPB'), (2124, 2137, 'CONDITION', 'visceral pain'), (2157, 2169, 'CONDITION', 'somatic pain'), (2171, 2175, 'OTHER', 'ESPB'), (2204, 2219, 'CONDITION', 'liver resection'), (2229, 2233, 'OTHER', 'ESBP'), (2250, 2259, 'OTHER', 'TAP block'), (2372, 2375, 'OTHER', 'TAP'), (2399, 2427, 'CONDITION', 'open liver resection surgery')]","[(0, 26), (34, 77), (101, 121), (163, 186), (254, 299), (335, 358), (492, 510), (641, 645), (660, 683), (775, 814), (873, 888), (1284, 1299), (1482, 1491), (1579, 1594), (1617, 1630), (1639, 1648), (1736, 1745), (1887, 1902), (2035, 2061), (2063, 2067), (2124, 2137), (2157, 2169), (2171, 2175), (2204, 2219), (2229, 2233), (2250, 2259), (2372, 2375), (2399, 2427)]","[(101, 121, 'CONDITION'), (163, 186, 'CONDITION'), (254, 299, 'CONDITION'), (335, 358, 'CONDITION'), (492, 510, 'CONDITION'), (641, 645, 'CONDITION'), (660, 683, 'CONDITION'), (873, 888, 'CONDITION'), (1284, 1299, 'CONDITION'), (1579, 1594, 'CONDITION'), (1617, 1630, 'CONDITION'), (1887, 1902, 'CONDITION'), (2124, 2137, 'CONDITION'), (2157, 2169, 'CONDITION'), (2204, 2219, 'CONDITION'), (2399, 2427, 'CONDITION')]","[(0, 26, 'OTHER'), (34, 77, 'OTHER'), (775, 814, 'OTHER'), (1482, 1491, 'OTHER'), (1639, 1648, 'OTHER'), (1736, 1745, 'OTHER'), (2035, 2061, 'OTHER'), (2063, 2067, 'OTHER'), (2171, 2175, 'OTHER'), (2229, 2233, 'OTHER'), (2250, 2259, 'OTHER'), (2372, 2375, 'OTHER')]"

198,NCT04091100,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"Effects of Electroacupuncture and Myofascial Release on Pain, Neck Functions and Depression Status in Patients With Tension-Type Headaches | Tension-type headaches (TTH) last from thirty minutes to seven days, were ranked second among the primary types of headaches. The diagnosis of TTH is made according to the diagnostic criteria of the Second Beta version of the International Classification of Headache Disorders. The causes of TTH include the activation of extremely tense peripheric afferent neurons through the head and neck muscles, muscle sensitivity and stress. Additionally, a limited range of motion (ROM) in the neck may also lead to TTH.

The treatment of TTH involve both pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods. It is known that the pharmacological treatment of TTH has a limited effect. However, previous studies have shown that physical therapy programs that include methods such as acupuncture, Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS), exercise, biofeedback, manipulation, cryotherapy, massage, strengthening of the neck muscles, stretching exercises are effective in alleviating TTH.

It has been observed that the trigger points in muscles play a role in TTH. Trigger points are generally defined as hyper-irritable points inside taut bands. It has been demonstrated that myofascial release, which is applied to the trigger points and is effective in relaxation treatments through stimulation of the neuromuscular system, relieves headaches via muscle relaxation. Electroacupuncture is another method used in relieving myofascial pain origin that involves the application of acupuncture needles to particular points and delivery of an electrical current at a specific frequency. The stimulation of muscle and skin tissues in affected areas is carried out by means of needles and the electrical current relieves pain and muscle spasms. In a meta-analysis study, it was found that electroacupuncture had a higher pain-relieving effect. However, a review of related studies deemed them to be lacking because the assessments were too limited to make it possible to unequivocally state that electroacupuncture has a high level of therapeutic efficacy.

The studies performed, however, did not examine the efficacy of electroacupuncture and myofascial release on TTH.

201,NCT00987688,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"Multi-centre Randomised Trial to Evaluate the Effect of Early Hypothermia on Neurological Function in Patients With Severe Traumatic Brain Injury. Including Renal Sub Study | Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and long term disability, particularly in young adults. Studies from Australia have shown that approximately half of those with severe traumatic brain injury will be severely disabled or dead 6 months post injury. Given the young age of many patients with severe TBI and the long term prevalence of major disability, the economic and more importantly the social cost to the community is very high.

Pre-hospital and hospital management of patients with severe brain injury focuses on prevention of additional injury due primarily to lack of oxygen and insufficient blood pressure. This includes optimising sedation and ventilation, maintaining the fluid balance and draining Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) and performing surgery where appropriate. In recent years there has been a research focus on specific pharmacologic interventions, however, to date, there has been no treatment that has been associated with improvement of neurological outcomes.

One treatment that shows promise is the application of hypothermia (cooling). This treatment is commonly used in Australia to decrease brain injury in patients with brain injury following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Cooling is thought to protect the brain using a number of mechanisms. There have been a number of animal studies that have looked at how cooling is protective and also some clinical research that suggests some benefit. However at the current time there is insufficient evidence to provide enough proof that cooling should be used routinely for patients with brain injury and like all treatments there can be some risks and side effects.

The POLAR trial has been developed to investigate whether early cooling of patients with severe traumatic brain injury is associated with better outcomes. It is a randomised controlled trial, which is a type of trial that provides the highest quality of evidence.

The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in the proportion of favourable neurological outcomes six months after severe traumatic brain injury in patients treated with early and sustained hypothermia, compared to standard normothermic management.","[(62, 73, 'OTHER', 'Hypothermia'), (116, 145, 'CONDITION', 'Severe Traumatic Brain Injury'), (175, 197, 'CONDITION', 'Traumatic brain injury'), (199, 202, 'CONDITION', 'TBI'), (360, 389, 'CONDITION', 'severe traumatic brain injury'), (488, 498, 'CONDITION', 'severe TBI'), (685, 704, 'CONDITION', 'severe brain injury'), (1234, 1245, 'OTHER', 'hypothermia'), (1247, 1254, 'OTHER', 'cooling'), (1344, 1356, 'CONDITION', 'brain injury'), (1399, 1406, 'OTHER', 'Cooling'), (1536, 1543, 'OTHER', 'cooling'), (1706, 1713, 'OTHER', 'cooling'), (1757, 1769, 'CONDITION', 'brain injury'), (1901, 1908, 'OTHER', 'cooling'), (1926, 1955, 'CONDITION', 'severe traumatic brain injury'), (2224, 2253, 'CONDITION', 'severe traumatic brain injury'), (2299, 2310, 'OTHER', 'hypothermia'), (2324, 2356, 'CONTROL', 'standard normothermic management')]","[(62, 73), (116, 145), (175, 197), (199, 202), (360, 389), (488, 498), (685, 704), (1234, 1245), (1247, 1254), (1344, 1356), (1399, 1406), (1536, 1543), (1706, 1713), (1757, 1769), (1901, 1908), (1926, 1955), (2224, 2253), (2299, 2310), (2324, 2356)]","[(116, 145, 'CONDITION'), (175, 197, 'CONDITION'), (199, 202, 'CONDITION'), (360, 389, 'CONDITION'), (488, 498, 'CONDITION'), (685, 704, 'CONDITION'), (1344, 1356, 'CONDITION'), (1757, 1769, 'CONDITION'), (1926, 1955, 'CONDITION'), (2224, 2253, 'CONDITION')]","[(62, 73, 'OTHER'), (1234, 1245, 'OTHER'), (1247, 1254, 'OTHER'), (1399, 1406, 'OTHER'), (1536, 1543, 'OTHER'), (1706, 1713, 'OTHER'), (1901, 1908, 'OTHER'), (2299, 2310, 'OTHER'), (2324, 2356, 'CONTROL')]"

212,NCT01236209,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"Stimulating Self Management in Patients With Fibromyalgia Through Web-based Situational Feedback | The overall objective of this randomized controlled study (RCT) financed by the Norwegian Research Council (grant no. 182012/V50) is to establish the effectiveness of situational feedback to the self-management of fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) using innovative means of patient-provider communication in a randomized controlled study (RCT). Thereby this project will contribute to the knowledge of treatment of patients with FMS. The effectiveness of the intervention will be expressed in terms of a) reduced pain, b) psychometric outcomes, c) quality of life, d) improved engagement in daily activities and e) prevented transition to chronic disability. We furthermore aim to 1) determine the effectiveness of providing regular situational feedback in enhancing self-management and, consequently 2) study the effectiveness of enhancing self-management in reducing pain and physical disability.

Self-management of chronic pain is increasingly seen as an important tool in providing adequate care to patients with FMS and other types of Chronic Non-malignant Pain. Enhancing the patient's self-management of her/his condition is thought to be effective in reducing pain and disability. However, sufficient empirical evidence to support this is yet unavailable. This may be due to the non-situational nature of many interventions studied so far: Patients are taught management skills in a clinical setting, and may not be able to successfully use these skills in daily care. Therefore, enhancing self-management of chronic pain, by providing immediate feedback that is directly related to patient's daily life (""situational"" feedback) complementary to care-as usual, is thought to be more effective than conventional interventions in a clinical setting. This may even be even more effective when the patient receives quick response feedback using mobile communication technology, i.e. any place any time.","[(45, 57, 'CONDITION', 'Fibromyalgia'), (66, 96, 'OTHER', 'Web-based Situational Feedback'), (266, 286, 'OTHER', 'situational feedback'), (313, 334, 'CONDITION', 'fibromyalgia syndrome'), (336, 339, 'CONDITION', 'FMS'), (367, 397, 'OTHER', 'patient-provider communication'), (522, 525, 'CONDITION', 'FMS'), (606, 610, 'CONDITION', 'pain'), (818, 846, 'OTHER', 'regular situational feedback'), (924, 949, 'OTHER', 'enhancing self-management'), (962, 966, 'CONDITION', 'pain'), (1012, 1024, 'CONDITION', 'chronic pain'), (1111, 1114, 'CONDITION', 'FMS'), (1134, 1160, 'CONDITION', 'Chronic Non-malignant Pain'), (1262, 1266, 'CONDITION', 'pain'), (1611, 1623, 'CONDITION', 'chronic pain'), (1707, 1729, 'OTHER', '""situational"" feedback'), (1800, 1848, 'CONTROL', 'conventional interventions in a clinical setting'), (1913, 1974, 'OTHER', 'quick response feedback using mobile communication technology')]","[(45, 57), (66, 96), (266, 286), (313, 334), (336, 339), (367, 397), (522, 525), (606, 610), (818, 846), (924, 949), (962, 966), (1012, 1024), (1111, 1114), (1134, 1160), (1262, 1266), (1611, 1623), (1707, 1729), (1800, 1848), (1913, 1974)]","[(45, 57, 'CONDITION'), (313, 334, 'CONDITION'), (336, 339, 'CONDITION'), (522, 525, 'CONDITION'), (606, 610, 'CONDITION'), (962, 966, 'CONDITION'), (1012, 1024, 'CONDITION'), (1111, 1114, 'CONDITION'), (1134, 1160, 'CONDITION'), (1262, 1266, 'CONDITION'), (1611, 1623, 'CONDITION')]","[(66, 96, 'OTHER'), (266, 286, 'OTHER'), (367, 397, 'OTHER'), (818, 846, 'OTHER'), (924, 949, 'OTHER'), (1707, 1729, 'OTHER'), (1800, 1848, 'CONTROL'), (1913, 1974, 'OTHER')]"

220,NCT04603352,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"Impact of an Orthotic Garment on Gross Motor Skill Acquisition for Infants With Down Syndrome | Infants with Down syndrome (DS) develop slower than their typically developing peers. Physical therapist (PT) supervised home programs have the potential to optimize gross motor development in a financially feasible way. An inexpensive orthotic garment (Hip Helpers®) is commonly employed by PTs as a home program supplement, but its effectiveness has not yet been investigated. The garment is worn as pliable shorts over a child's lower extremities to keep upper legs together, promoting a narrow base of support. This encourages activation of upright postural muscles to improve gross motor skill development. The purpose of this randomized controlled study is to investigate the impact of a home program using the Hip Helpers® orthotic garment on gross motor skill acquisition in infants with DS. We hypothesize that the addition of a structured home program using Hip Helpers®, supervised by a PT and implemented by parents, will increase the rate at which infants with DS acquire gross motor skills. Thirty-four participants, consisting of children who are at least three-months-old and are not yet able maintain sitting independently, will be randomly assigned to a control (n=17) or intervention group (n=17). PTs at pediatric therapy agencies will initiate the home program and administer the Gross Motor Function Measure-88 (GMFM-88) at regular intervals to monitor gross motor skill acquisition until the child is able to take three independent steps. Groups will be compared on the length of time elapsed between the acquisition of identified gross motor skills using independent t-tests. GMFM-88 scores will be compared between the two groups at different ages to identify trends using independent t-tests.

Many factors including genetics, diet, diseases, drugs, socioeconomic factors and environmental variables were considered to be related to the development of presbyacusis. Evidences have shown that genetic factors play an important role on presbyacusis. However, which genes or their genotypes are associated with presbycusis remain unknown.

The aim of this project was to evaluate the association between the genotype of candidate genes and presbyacusis by cross-section and case-control study. In the first stage, the investigators plan to select 700 healthy subjects older than 50 with symmetric, sensorineural hearing loss. The subjects will receive basic otologic examination, pure tone audiometry, questionnaire, and genotype analysis. Because gender and age would affect hearing loss significantly, The investigators will convert the hearing level of all subjects into a gender and age independent Z-score according to ISO 7029 standard. And, The investigators define subjects within higher 30 % of Z-score as the presbyacusis group, and subjects within lower 30% of Z-score as the control group. Finally, The investigators perform Chi square analysis to test the association between genotype of candidate genes or their combinations in both groups, and calculate the odds ratio for presbyacusis between different genotype of candidate genes. Further more, we will evaluate the effect of genotype of candidate genes, environment factors, and gene-environmental interaction on the severity of presbyacusis by multivariate logistic regression.

In the second stage, The investigators wish to know the pattern of genotype and hearing level in the high risk families, according to results from the first stage, by description and case-control study.

Secondary aims are to evaluate frailty prevalence, to describe with details health according to age, and to verify the frailty index validity for predicting falls, hospitalisation and death, in this population of ADS-MR patients aged over 20 years.

233,NCT01751347,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"Bupivacaine Versus Lidocaine Local Anesthesia in Elective Outpatient Hand Surgery: A Randomized Controlled Trial | The use of local anesthetics has become an important aspect of pain management in surgical settings and is currently recommended in pain management guidelines.

Elective outpatient hand surgeries, such as carpal tunnel or trigger finger release, cause minimum tissue disruption and are short in duration. As a result, these local anesthetic agents are a major component in post-operative pain control. The most commonly used local anesthetic agents are Lidocaine and Bupivacaine. Lidocaine acts faster (within 2-5 minutes of injection) and for this reason is often favored in outpatient setting for pre-incisional injection. However its effects only last up to 2 hours, without epinephrine, and 3 hours, with epinephrine. On the other hand, Bupivacaine, has a slower onset of action (about 5-10 minutes after injection) but its effects last much longer, for about 4-8 hours. The delay in onset of action makes it a less popular option as a primary source of local anesthesia in outpatient hand surgery.

Given the longer duration of anesthesia offered by Bupivacaine, the investigators believe that by giving it pre-operatively in elective outpatient hand surgeries will offer more effective post operative pain control compared to using Lidocaine only. There is limited published data confirming the effectiveness of use of pre-operative Bupivicaine in improved postoperative pain control and decreased consumption of narcotics. Therefore, the aim in this study is to compare the postoperative pain experienced by patients undergoing either elective carpal tunnel release or trigger finger release as well as their use of pain medications when the incision site is infiltrated preemptively with Lidocaine versus Bupivacaine.

The investigators believe that adequate post surgical pain control is essential for patients' full functional recovery. Poorly controlled post surgical pain increases incidence of surgery related complications and thus increased health care costs. It can also reduce patients' mobility, delay their return to full function,. If poorly controlled, post surgical pain may progress to chronic pain and rarely complex regional pain syndromes may ensue.","[(0, 11, 'DRUG', 'Bupivacaine'), (19, 28, 'DRUG', 'Lidocaine'), (69, 81, 'CONDITION', 'Hand Surgery'), (178, 182, 'CONDITION', 'pain'), (247, 251, 'CONDITION', 'pain'), (296, 310, 'CONDITION', 'hand surgeries'), (337, 359, 'CONDITION', 'trigger finger release'), (488, 507, 'CONDITION', 'post-operative pain'), (568, 577, 'DRUG', 'Lidocaine'), (582, 593, 'DRUG', 'Bupivacaine'), (595, 604, 'DRUG', 'Lidocaine'), (793, 804, 'DRUG', 'epinephrine'), (824, 835, 'DRUG', 'epinephrine'), (856, 867, 'DRUG', 'Bupivacaine'), (1104, 1116, 'CONDITION', 'hand surgery'), (1170, 1181, 'DRUG', 'Bupivacaine'), (1307, 1326, 'CONDITION', 'post operative pain'), (1353, 1362, 'DRUG', 'Lidocaine'), (1454, 1465, 'DRUG', 'Bupivicaine'), (1478, 1496, 'CONDITION', 'postoperative pain'), (1596, 1614, 'CONDITION', 'postoperative pain'), (1691, 1713, 'CONDITION', 'trigger finger release'), (1738, 1742, 'CONDITION', 'pain'), (1811, 1820, 'DRUG', 'Lidocaine'), (1828, 1839, 'DRUG', 'Bupivacaine'), (1882, 1900, 'CONDITION', 'post surgical pain'), (1980, 1998, 'CONDITION', 'post surgical pain'), (2189, 2207, 'CONDITION', 'post surgical pain'), (2224, 2236, 'CONDITION', 'chronic pain'), (2256, 2279, 'CONDITION', 'regional pain syndromes')]","[(0, 11), (19, 28), (69, 81), (178, 182), (247, 251), (296, 310), (337, 359), (488, 507), (568, 577), (582, 593), (595, 604), (793, 804), (824, 835), (856, 867), (1104, 1116), (1170, 1181), (1307, 1326), (1353, 1362), (1454, 1465), (1478, 1496), (1596, 1614), (1691, 1713), (1738, 1742), (1811, 1820), (1828, 1839), (1882, 1900), (1980, 1998), (2189, 2207), (2224, 2236), (2256, 2279)]","[(69, 81, 'CONDITION'), (178, 182, 'CONDITION'), (247, 251, 'CONDITION'), (296, 310, 'CONDITION'), (337, 359, 'CONDITION'), (488, 507, 'CONDITION'), (1104, 1116, 'CONDITION'), (1307, 1326, 'CONDITION'), (1478, 1496, 'CONDITION'), (1596, 1614, 'CONDITION'), (1691, 1713, 'CONDITION'), (1738, 1742, 'CONDITION'), (1882, 1900, 'CONDITION'), (1980, 1998, 'CONDITION'), (2189, 2207, 'CONDITION'), (2224, 2236, 'CONDITION'), (2256, 2279, 'CONDITION')]","[(0, 11, 'DRUG'), (19, 28, 'DRUG'), (568, 577, 'DRUG'), (582, 593, 'DRUG'), (595, 604, 'DRUG'), (793, 804, 'DRUG'), (824, 835, 'DRUG'), (856, 867, 'DRUG'), (1170, 1181, 'DRUG'), (1353, 1362, 'DRUG'), (1454, 1465, 'DRUG'), (1811, 1820, 'DRUG'), (1828, 1839, 'DRUG')]"

It was shown previously that rehabilitation is an important therapeutic supplement for micrographia in early disease. However, what is unknown is how motor learning impacts on the underlying neural networks in patients with different disease progression and how this interacts with dopaminergic medication. Furthermore, difficulties with upper limb motor control has a severe impact on the daily lives of PD patients since fine motor skills become increasingly important for the use of smartphones and tablets. Therefore, the current project will include a newly developed Swipe-Slide Pattern test, resembling the pattern codes used to unlock smartphones and tablets. This task will be used to determine learning-induced neuroplasticity of cortico-striatal effective connectivity across disease stages in PD.

243,NCT03985761,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"Utilizing Gaming Mechanics to Optimize Telerehabilitation Adherence in Persons With Stroke | This trial studies the impact of motivational strategies designed by the gaming industry on adherence to a home tele-rehabilitation program designed to improve hand function in persons with stroke. A growing literature suggests that the extended practice of challenging hand tasks can produce measurable changes in hand function in persons with stroke. Current health care delivery systems do not support this volume of directly supervised rehabilitation, making it necessary for patients to perform a substantial amount of activity at home, unsupervised. Unfortunately, adherence to unsupervised home exercise regimens is quite poor in this population. The investigator's goal is to assess the impact of several well-established game design strategies: 1) Scaffolded increases in game difficulty 2) In-game rewards 3) Quests with enhanced narrative. The investigator's will utilize these enhancements to study their impact on motivation to perform a tele-rehabilitation- based home exercise program, adherence to the program and changes in hand function. The proposed study will utilize a system of novel rehabilitation technologies designed to facilitate home exercise performance. Subjects will perform 3 simulated rehabilitation activities supported by a passive exoskeleton, an infrared camera and software that will allow subjects to exercise at home. The investigator's will investigate: 1) Differences in measures of motivation elicited by motivationally enhanced simulations and un-enhanced control versions.2) The impact of motivational enhancements on actual adherence to a tele-rehabilitation program in persons with stroke and 3) The impact of motivational enhancement on improvements in hand function achieved by these subjects. This proposal will address a critical gap in modern rehabilitation - adherence to autonomous rehabilitation programs. Patient participation in unsupervised rehabilitation is one of the assumptions underpinning our health care system. This said, no data collected to date supports that adherence is acceptable. The technology and methodology in this proposal are an important step towards leveraging extensive research and development done by the computer gaming industry into improved rehabilitation practice.","[(10, 26, 'OTHER', 'Gaming Mechanics'), (39, 57, 'PHYSICAL', 'Telerehabilitation'), (84, 90, 'CONDITION', 'Stroke'), (126, 149, 'BEHAVIOURAL', 'motivational strategies'), (200, 232, 'PHYSICAL', 'home tele-rehabilitation program'), (283, 289, 'CONDITION', 'stroke'), (438, 444, 'CONDITION', 'stroke'), (1044, 1092, 'PHYSICAL', 'tele-rehabilitation- based home exercise program'), (1250, 1263, 'PHYSICAL', 'home exercise'), (1301, 1336, 'PHYSICAL', 'simulated rehabilitation activities'), (1352, 1371, 'PHYSICAL', 'passive exoskeleton'), (1433, 1449, 'PHYSICAL', 'exercise at home'), (1541, 1576, 'BEHAVIOURAL', 'motivationally enhanced simulations'), (1581, 1600, 'CONTROL', 'un-enhanced control'), (1627, 1652, 'BEHAVIOURAL', 'motivational enhancements'), (1678, 1705, 'PHYSICAL', 'tele-rehabilitation program'), (1722, 1728, 'CONDITION', 'stroke'), (1750, 1774, 'BEHAVIOURAL', 'motivational enhancement'), (1918, 1952, 'PHYSICAL', 'autonomous rehabilitation programs')]","[(10, 26), (39, 57), (84, 90), (126, 149), (200, 232), (283, 289), (438, 444), (1044, 1092), (1250, 1263), (1301, 1336), (1352, 1371), (1433, 1449), (1541, 1576), (1581, 1600), (1627, 1652), (1678, 1705), (1722, 1728), (1750, 1774), (1918, 1952)]","[(84, 90, 'CONDITION'), (283, 289, 'CONDITION'), (438, 444, 'CONDITION'), (1722, 1728, 'CONDITION')]","[(10, 26, 'OTHER'), (39, 57, 'PHYSICAL'), (126, 149, 'BEHAVIOURAL'), (200, 232, 'PHYSICAL'), (1044, 1092, 'PHYSICAL'), (1250, 1263, 'PHYSICAL'), (1301, 1336, 'PHYSICAL'), (1352, 1371, 'PHYSICAL'), (1433, 1449, 'PHYSICAL'), (1541, 1576, 'BEHAVIOURAL'), (1581, 1600, 'CONTROL'), (1627, 1652, 'BEHAVIOURAL'), (1678, 1705, 'PHYSICAL'), (1750, 1774, 'BEHAVIOURAL'), (1918, 1952, 'PHYSICAL')]"

253,NCT01605357,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"A Randomized, Open Label Clinical Trial of Sustained Hypernatremia for the Prevention and Treatment of Cerebral Edema in Traumatic Brain Injury | Cerebral edema is seen heterogenous group of neurological disease states that mainly fall under the categories of metabolic, infectious, neoplasia, cerebrovascular, and traumatic brain injury disease states. Regardless of the driving force, cerebral edema is defined as the accumulation of fluid in the brain's intracellular and extracellular spaces. This occurs secondary to alterations in the complex interplay between four distinct fluid compartments within the cranium. In any human cranium; fluid is contained in the blood, the cerebrospinal fluid, interstitial fluid of the brain parenchyma, and the intracellular fluid of the neurons and glia. Fluid movement occurs normally between these compartments and depends on specific concentrations of solutes (such as sodium) and water. In brain-injured states, the normal regulation of this process is disturbed and cerebral edema can develop. Cerebral edema leads to increased intracranial pressure and mortality secondary to brain tissue compression, given the confines of the fixed-volume cranium. Additionally, secondary neuronal dysfunction or death can occur at the cellular level secondary to the disruption of ion gradients that control metabolism and function.

While studies utilizing bolus dosing of hyperosmolar therapy to target signs or symptoms of increased intracranial pressure secondary to cerebral edema are numerous, there is a paucity of studies relating to continuous infusion of hyperosmolar therapy for targeted sustained hypernatremia for the prevention and treatment of cerebral edema.

However, these drugs presented as ""symptomatic treatment"" of AD are considered as having only a weak effect on the course of AD. The reimbursement of these drugs is regularly challenged due to the lack of evidence for the impact of these drugs on milestones stages of AD evolution (survival without severe dementia, restriction in Basic Activities of Daily Living - BADL) and on major consequences in public health (hospitalization and institutionalization). The great majority of previous randomized controlled trials conducted with CI have had a too short duration and the end points were limited to cognition (ADAS Cog scale), IADL (Instrumental Activities of Daily Living) function and Global Impression of Change. New evidences from the DOMINO trial (1) conducted in UK, independently of the pharmaceutical industry, showed that the true effect of CI might be more to avoid or to delay the cognitive or functional decline in AD than to improve patients; the institutionalisation (2) was also delayed. However, this trial was conducted in patients with moderate to severe AD, and the interest of the drugs at the mild to moderate stage remains questionable.

The investigators have shown that a good surrogate marker of survival without severe dementia would be an increase of ADAS Cog scale of more than six points (3). A post hoc reanalysis of the pivotal RCT with two CI showed that in mild to moderate patients, CI was associated with a 15% decrease of patients with a deterioration of ADAS-Cog of more than six points in six months. Thus at the beginning of dementia the real effect of CI might be more of delaying the cognitive and functional decline, than to improve the patients. The main objective of the SOS trial is to demonstrate that the benefit of CI at the early phase of dementia is the same as at the later phase.","[(42, 67, 'DRUG', 'Cholinesterase Inhibitors'), (97, 122, 'DRUG', 'Cholinesterase inhibitors'), (124, 126, 'DRUG', 'CI'), (180, 216, 'CONDITION', ""mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease""), (218, 220, 'CONDITION', 'AD'), (322, 324, 'CONDITION', 'AD'), (386, 388, 'CONDITION', 'AD'), (529, 531, 'CONDITION', 'AD'), (560, 575, 'CONDITION', 'severe dementia'), (795, 797, 'DRUG', 'CI'), (1114, 1116, 'DRUG', 'CI'), (1191, 1193, 'CONDITION', 'AD'), (1318, 1339, 'CONDITION', 'moderate to severe AD'), (1502, 1517, 'CONDITION', 'severe dementia'), (1636, 1638, 'DRUG', 'CI'), (1681, 1683, 'DRUG', 'CI'), (1828, 1836, 'CONDITION', 'dementia'), (1856, 1858, 'DRUG', 'CI'), (1889, 1921, 'CONDITION', 'cognitive and functional decline'), (2027, 2029, 'DRUG', 'CI'), (2037, 2060, 'CONDITION', 'early phase of dementia')]","[(42, 67), (97, 122), (124, 126), (180, 216), (218, 220), (322, 324), (386, 388), (529, 531), (560, 575), (795, 797), (1114, 1116), (1191, 1193), (1318, 1339), (1502, 1517), (1636, 1638), (1681, 1683), (1828, 1836), (1856, 1858), (1889, 1921), (2027, 2029), (2037, 2060)]","[(180, 216, 'CONDITION'), (218, 220, 'CONDITION'), (322, 324, 'CONDITION'), (386, 388, 'CONDITION'), (529, 531, 'CONDITION'), (560, 575, 'CONDITION'), (1191, 1193, 'CONDITION'), (1318, 1339, 'CONDITION'), (1502, 1517, 'CONDITION'), (1828, 1836, 'CONDITION'), (1889, 1921, 'CONDITION'), (2037, 2060, 'CONDITION')]","[(42, 67, 'DRUG'), (97, 122, 'DRUG'), (124, 126, 'DRUG'), (795, 797, 'DRUG'), (1114, 1116, 'DRUG'), (1636, 1638, 'DRUG'), (1681, 1683, 'DRUG'), (1856, 1858, 'DRUG'), (2027, 2029, 'DRUG')]"

278,NCT04967274,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"Contributions of the Reticulospinal System to Movement Control and Functional Recovery in Patients With Spinal Cord Injury | Accurate movement execution is a result of a complex interplay between various muscle groups whose activity is controlled by different areas of the central nervous system. Besides the corticospinal system, the phylogenetically old reticulospinal system is a key motor system controlling different elementary movements including posture, locomotion and reaching across all mammals. In contrast to the extensively investigated corticospinal system, there is only sparse knowledge on the motor physiology of the functionally important reticulospinal system in humans. Reticulospinal motor control can be assessed with the StartReact paradigm which is based on the activation of reticulospinal motor circuitries by startling acoustic stimuli. The StartReact phenomenon is characterized by a shortening in movement reaction time which is mediated by a startle-triggered, early release of a planned motor program by the reticulospinal system. Thus, StartReact is a unique tool to examine reticulospinal involvement on human motor control under physiological and pathological conditions. StartReact assessments will be supplemented by comprehensive 3-D kinematic analysis and muscle activity recordings (i.e. electromyography) to gain quantitative insights into reticulospinal movement control.

The first objective of this clinical study is to gain more insights into the mechanisms underlying StartReact and to advance the knowledge on reticulo-spinal motor physiology regarding different movement tasks (i.e. simple single-joint movements, complex multi-joint movements and bilateral hand movements) in healthy subjects. The findings of these experiments will provide new insights into proximal-distal, flexor-extensor and upper-lower extremity gradients in reticulospinal motor control of healthy subjects. Moreover, the results will expand the StartReact paradigm to complex, functionally more relevant movements (i.e. reaching and stepping tasks requiring endpoint accuracy; co-operative, bilateral hand movements) for which the involvement of the reticulo-spinal system is not yet understood.

The second goal of this project is to use the StartReact paradigm to shed more light onto the role of reticulospinal plasticity in functional recovery of patients with spinal cord injury (SCI). Whereas preclinical findings emphasize a remarkable potential of the reticulospinal system for neuroplastic adaptations underlying functional recovery, there is only little evidence from clinical trials in the field of SCI. First, the study aims at monitoring StartReact effects in hand and leg muscles of patients with acute SCI over a period of 6 months. Simultaneous tracking of StartReact effects and motor recovery will allow to closely relate processes of reticulospinal plasticity to functional recovery in patients with acute SCI. Second, the focus will be on the re-weighting of descending motor control (i.e. cortico- vs. reticulospinal system) in response to SCI and investigate the distinct contributions of the cortico- and reticulospinal system to motor recovery in patients with chronic SCI.

The findings of this project will advance the mechanistic understanding on the motor physiology and neurorestorative capacity of the reticulospinal system in humans.

307,NCT05346471,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"Infra- and Supratentorial Neuromonitoring in Patients With Posterior Fossa Lesions: DUAL-ICP Trial | Invasive neuromonitoring of intracranial pressure (ICP) is an important element of neurosurgical critical care that is used primarily as an indicator of adequate cerebral perfusion in patients, when clinical observation is not an option. Due to the constraint in size and the critical structures within the posterior fossa, detection of intracranial pressure particularly in the postoperative phase has been deemed desirable in patients with surgery in this region, particularly in those subjected to prolonged procedures and critical care.

The posterior fossa is an anatomically constricted compartment with narrow spaces and intracranial hypertension quickly leads to brainstem damage and neurological dysfunction. ICP in the supratentorial space not necessarily correlates with ICP in the infratentorial space. Some authors claim that it would be beneficial to measure ICP in infratentorial space after posterior fossa surgery in some cases.

The relationship between the intracranial pressure profiles in the supratentorial and infratentorial compartments remain unclear. After a neurosurgical operation in the posterior fossa there are most likely pressure differences between supra- and infratentorial spaces. It is well known that the pressure within the skull is unevenly distributed, with appreciable ICP gradients.

Thus, the investigators intend to apply the intracranial multimodal monitoring in both infratentorial and supratentorial compartments simultaneously. Such coincident measurements most likely will be the most sensitive way to assess focal swelling, ischemia and tissue perfusion, or other relevant complications in the posterior fossa structures.

The goal of this study is to test whether direct infratentorial monitoring is a more efficacious method for detecting dynamic changes in the operative compartment and whether it is safe, in view of the critical structures within the region.","[(59, 82, 'CONDITION', 'Posterior Fossa Lesions'), (1676, 1684, 'CONDITION', 'ischemia')]","[(59, 82), (1676, 1684)]","[(59, 82, 'CONDITION'), (1676, 1684, 'CONDITION')]",[]

Beside seizures people suffering from epilepsy experience several challenges related to education, work and everyday life such as learning-, problem-solving-, memory-, concentration-, attention difficulties and fatigue.

It is generally approved that physical activity (PA) has a positive effect on physical as well as mental factors. However, people with epilepsy are found to be less active and PA is rarely offered or recommended as supplement to anti-epileptic medical treatment. Few studies have investigated the effect of PA in subjects with epilepsy and additional studies of high methodical quality are needed to enable evidence-based information and counselling.

This study is carried through as a randomized controlled trial which investigates the effect of participation in a 10-week cardio exercise program in people with Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy aged 15-50.

319,NCT05245955,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"Feasibility and Validity of Robotic Assessments With the ReHapticKnob to Characterize Kinaesthesia and Haptic Perception of the Hand in Patients With Parkinson's Disease: an Exploratory Study | It has been shown that patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have impaired kinaesthesia and haptic perception of the upper limbs. In PD patients, these impairments might be involved in the development of hypometria or bradykinesia and may play a role in postural deficits, thereby significantly contributing to the overall disability level.

Dedicated conventional or robot-assisted training might improve sensory-motor function in PD patients. In order to provide efficient robot-assisted therapy, robotic devices have to be able to tailor the therapy difficulty to the individual impairment profile of each patient. For difficulty adaptation in robot-assisted therapy, it is important to assess the impairment profiles with the same robotic platform that would be used for therapy, therefore minimizing costs or potential errors coming from the use of different devices. However, up to now, little emphasis has been placed on providing sensory-motor robot-assisted therapy for the upper limbs to persons with PD based on their individual level of impairment.

The aim of this study is therefore to evaluate if the assessments of sensory-motor hand function implemented on a robotic device for hand rehabilitation, i.e. the ReHapticKnob, are suitable to measure the impairments of kinaesthesia and haptic perception observed in subjects with Parkinson's disease.

If the assessments implemented in the ReHapticKnob are sensitive enough to detect a difference between the sensory-motor function of PD patients and healthy subjects, the device might in the future be used to assess improvements before and after sensory-motor therapy. This is a necessary step before the investigators can use these assessments to tailor the difficulty level of the therapy performed with the ReHapticKnob and to investigate the benefits and impact of such a therapy on the kinaesthetic and haptic impairments of persons with PD.","[(150, 169, 'CONDITION', ""Parkinson's Disease""), (231, 250, 'CONDITION', ""Parkinson's disease""), (252, 254, 'CONDITION', 'PD'), (328, 330, 'CONDITION', 'PD'), (399, 409, 'CONDITION', 'hypometria'), (413, 425, 'CONDITION', 'bradykinesia'), (627, 629, 'CONDITION', 'PD'), (1206, 1208, 'CONDITION', 'PD'), (1538, 1557, 'CONDITION', ""Parkinson's disease""), (1693, 1695, 'CONDITION', 'PD'), (2103, 2105, 'CONDITION', 'PD')]","[(150, 169), (231, 250), (252, 254), (328, 330), (399, 409), (413, 425), (627, 629), (1206, 1208), (1538, 1557), (1693, 1695), (2103, 2105)]","[(150, 169, 'CONDITION'), (231, 250, 'CONDITION'), (252, 254, 'CONDITION'), (328, 330, 'CONDITION'), (399, 409, 'CONDITION'), (413, 425, 'CONDITION'), (627, 629, 'CONDITION'), (1206, 1208, 'CONDITION'), (1538, 1557, 'CONDITION'), (1693, 1695, 'CONDITION'), (2103, 2105, 'CONDITION')]",[]

Repair-HD is an EU FP7 consortium that aims to establish all the preclinical requirements for transplantation of stem cell-derived neurons in HD in order to replace those lost to the disease process. These requirements include the generation of new clinical assessments for detailed monitoring of patients with HD who have undergone cell replacement therapy.

This protocol describes the beta testing of a new clinical assessment battery: Core Assessment Protocol for Intrastriatal Transplantation in HD version 2 (CAPIT-HD beta / CAPIT-HD2). CAPIT-HD beta represents a substantial revision of a previous CAPIT-HD battery published over 20 years ago, which is in need of updating in order to accommodate knowledge from clinical transplant studies over this time and to take advantage of technological advances in patient assessment.

HD is a complex disorder in which there is relentless deterioration of motor, cognitive and behavioural functions, usually from mid-life onwards. The original CAPIT battery aimed to capture elements of change in all three domains, but was based predominantly on subjective semi-quantitative assessment tools that have poor inter-rater reliability. Moreover, a number of deficits, such as impairments in social cognition, were not recognised when the original CAPIT-HD battery was constructed, so we have developed novel assessments of these deficits, some of which are included in CAPIT-HD beta. The beta testing will take place in established HD clinical centres in Cardiff, Manchester, Paris, and Munster by teams of researchers who are experienced in leading clinic research in HD. Patients with early to moderate HD will be assessed at baseline, and at one and twelve months later, to assess the reliability and sensitivity of the CAPIT-HD beta battery.

CAR T cells are delivered via an indwelling catheter into the tumor resection cavity or ventricular system in children and young adults with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), diffuse midline glioma (DMG), and recurrent or refractory CNS tumors.

A child or young adult meeting all eligibility criteria, including having a CNS catheter placed into the tumor resection cavity or into their ventricular system, and meeting none of the exclusion criteria, will have their T cells collected. The T cells will then be bioengineered into a second-generation CAR T cell that targets B7H3-expressing tumor cells. Patients will be assigned to one of 3 treatment arms based on location or type of their tumor. Patients with supratentorial tumors will be assigned to Arm A, and will receive their treatment into the tumor cavity. Patients with either infratentorial or metastatic/leptomeningeal tumors will be assigned to Arm B, and will have their treatment delivered into the ventricular system. The first 3 patients enrolled onto the study must be at least 15 years of age and assigned to Arm A or Arm B. Patients with DIPG will be assigned to Arm C and have their treatment delivered into the ventricular system. The patient's newly engineered T cells will be administered via the indwelling catheter for two courses. In the first course patients in Arms A and B will receive a weekly dose of CAR T cells for three weeks, followed by a week off, an examination period, and then another course of weekly doses for three weeks. Patients in Arm C will receive a dose of CAR T cells every other week for 3 weeks, followed by a week off, an examination period, and then dosing every other week for 3 weeks. Following the two courses, patients in all Arms will undergo a series of studies including MRI to evaluate the effect of the CAR T cells and may have the opportunity to continue receiving additional courses of CAR T cells if the patient has not had adverse effects and if more of their T cells are available.

The hypothesis is that an adequate amount of B7H3-specific CAR T cells can be manufactured to complete two courses of treatment with 3 or 2 doses given on a weekly schedule followed by one week off in each course. The other hypothesis is that B7H3-specific CAR T cells can safely be administered through an indwelling CNS catheter or delivered directly into the brain via indwelling catheter to allow the T cells to directly interact with the tumor cells for each patient enrolled on the study. Secondary aims of the study will include evaluating CAR T cell distribution with the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the extent to which CAR T cells egress or traffic into the peripheral circulation or blood stream, and, if tissues samples from multiple timepoints are available, also evaluate disease response to B7-H3 CAR T cell locoregional therapy.","[(17, 42, 'SURGICAL', 'B7-H3-Specific CAR T Cell'), (74, 106, 'CONDITION', 'Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma'), (107, 129, 'CONDITION', 'Diffuse Midline Glioma'), (134, 197, 'CONDITION', 'Recurrent or Refractory Pediatric Central Nervous System Tumors'), (291, 416, 'SURGICAL', 'autologous CD4+ and CD8+ T cells lentivirally transduced to express a B7H3-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and EGFRt'), (418, 429, 'SURGICAL', 'CAR T cells'), (480, 485, 'CONDITION', 'tumor'), (559, 591, 'CONDITION', 'diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma'), (593, 597, 'CONDITION', 'DIPG'), (600, 622, 'CONDITION', 'diffuse midline glioma'), (624, 627, 'CONDITION', 'DMG'), (634, 668, 'CONDITION', 'recurrent or refractory CNS tumors'), (776, 781, 'CONDITION', 'tumor'), (958, 986, 'SURGICAL', 'second-generation CAR T cell'), (1016, 1021, 'CONDITION', 'tumor'), (1117, 1122, 'CONDITION', 'tumor'), (1138, 1159, 'CONDITION', 'supratentorial tumors'), (1229, 1234, 'CONDITION', 'tumor'), (1264, 1314, 'CONDITION', 'infratentorial or metastatic/leptomeningeal tumors'), (1535, 1539, 'CONDITION', 'DIPG'), (1810, 1821, 'SURGICAL', 'CAR T cells'), (1984, 1995, 'SURGICAL', 'CAR T cells'), (2244, 2255, 'SURGICAL', 'CAR T cells'), (2329, 2340, 'SURGICAL', 'CAR T cells'), (2474, 2499, 'SURGICAL', 'B7H3-specific CAR T cells'), (2672, 2697, 'SURGICAL', 'B7H3-specific CAR T cells'), (2834, 2841, 'SURGICAL', 'T cells'), (2872, 2877, 'CONDITION', 'tumor'), (2976, 2986, 'SURGICAL', 'CAR T cell'), (3056, 3067, 'SURGICAL', 'CAR T cells'), (3233, 3249, 'SURGICAL', 'B7-H3 CAR T cell')]","[(17, 42), (74, 106), (107, 129), (134, 197), (291, 416), (418, 429), (480, 485), (559, 591), (593, 597), (600, 622), (624, 627), (634, 668), (776, 781), (958, 986), (1016, 1021), (1117, 1122), (1138, 1159), (1229, 1234), (1264, 1314), (1535, 1539), (1810, 1821), (1984, 1995), (2244, 2255), (2329, 2340), (2474, 2499), (2672, 2697), (2834, 2841), (2872, 2877), (2976, 2986), (3056, 3067), (3233, 3249)]","[(74, 106, 'CONDITION'), (107, 129, 'CONDITION'), (134, 197, 'CONDITION'), (480, 485, 'CONDITION'), (559, 591, 'CONDITION'), (593, 597, 'CONDITION'), (600, 622, 'CONDITION'), (624, 627, 'CONDITION'), (634, 668, 'CONDITION'), (776, 781, 'CONDITION'), (1016, 1021, 'CONDITION'), (1117, 1122, 'CONDITION'), (1138, 1159, 'CONDITION'), (1229, 1234, 'CONDITION'), (1264, 1314, 'CONDITION'), (1535, 1539, 'CONDITION'), (2872, 2877, 'CONDITION')]","[(17, 42, 'SURGICAL'), (291, 416, 'SURGICAL'), (418, 429, 'SURGICAL'), (958, 986, 'SURGICAL'), (1810, 1821, 'SURGICAL'), (1984, 1995, 'SURGICAL'), (2244, 2255, 'SURGICAL'), (2329, 2340, 'SURGICAL'), (2474, 2499, 'SURGICAL'), (2672, 2697, 'SURGICAL'), (2834, 2841, 'SURGICAL'), (2976, 2986, 'SURGICAL'), (3056, 3067, 'SURGICAL'), (3233, 3249, 'SURGICAL')]"

Building upon Uganda's growing mHealth infrastructure to pilot a scalable short message service (SMS) system to remind caregivers of their children's upcoming vaccination visits, it was hypothesized that the SMS intervention will increase immunization coverage in a cost-effective and affordable manner that would make it scalable. The study design was an investigator-blinded, multi-center, parallel groups randomized controlled trial with randomization occurring at the caregiver level in select health facilities of Arua District in Uganda. Enrollment took place at the time of Pentavalent 1 vaccination, and both arms included standard of care provided by the health worker. However, in the intervention arm, caregivers also received SMS text messages reminding them to return for their children's second and third doses of Pentavalent vaccine (four and eight weeks after the first dose of Pentavalent vaccine) and measles-containing vaccine (9 months of age). The primary outcome of interest is vaccination coverage at 12 months of age among children enrolled in the study and will be measured by comparing Penta3 and MCV coverage between arms.

TST (Triple stimulation technique) combines two techniques used in neurologic diagnosis: magnetic stimulation and electroneuromyography. It is based on the principle of two collisions between the descending central stimulation (magnetic stimulation) and the ascending peripheric stimulation. TST allows to better quantify central nervous system diseases. The abnormal amplitude registered by TST is proportional to the intensity of conduction disorders. The evaluation of these disorders is more precise than with the magnetic stimulation technique alone.

The Nine Hole Pegs technique is a simple manual dexterity test, commonly used in ergotherapy. The participant tries to place 9 pegs in a 9 holes perforated plate, and then tries to remove them as quickly as possible. The hand must stay in a depression within the plate, thereby insuring a constant distance between the hand and the pegs.

The nine hole peg will be realized first, and the triple stimulation examination performed after. The acquired data will be analyzed in order to find a correlation between the impairment level given by these two tests.","[(126, 144, 'CONDITION', 'Multiple Sclerosis'), (365, 383, 'CONDITION', 'multiple sclerosis')]","[(126, 144), (365, 383)]","[(126, 144, 'CONDITION'), (365, 383, 'CONDITION')]",[]

The ability to bear weight on the legs is important during functional movements such as rising from a chair, standing and walking. Diminished weight transfer contributes to asymmetries during walking which commonly leads to greater energy expenditure. Moreover, deficits in bearing weight on the paretic leg contribute to lateral instability and are associated with decreased walking speed and increased risk of falling in individuals post-stroke. These functional limitations affect community participation and life quality. Thus, restoring the ability to bear weight on the legs, i.e., limb loading, is a critical goal for rehabilitation post-stroke. The purpose of this research is to identify the impairments in neuromechanical mechanisms of limb loading and determine whether limb loading responses can be retrained by induced forced limb loading.","[(82, 96, 'CONDITION', 'Chronic Stroke'), (99, 105, 'CONDITION', 'Stroke'), (180, 191, 'CONDITION', 'hemiparesis'), (199, 205, 'CONDITION', 'stroke'), (743, 754, 'CONDITION', 'post-stroke'), (948, 959, 'CONDITION', 'post-stroke'), (1132, 1159, 'PHYSICAL', 'induced forced limb loading')]","[(82, 96), (99, 105), (180, 191), (199, 205), (743, 754), (948, 959), (1132, 1159)]","[(82, 96, 'CONDITION'), (99, 105, 'CONDITION'), (180, 191, 'CONDITION'), (199, 205, 'CONDITION'), (743, 754, 'CONDITION'), (948, 959, 'CONDITION')]","[(1132, 1159, 'PHYSICAL')]"

This disorder is the most common cause of inherited mental disability. The prevalence of the Fragile X syndrome has been established at 1 in 2,500 males and 1 in 4000 females.

Despite moderate to severe mental retardation, fragile X patients exhibit macroorchidism, an elongated face, long ears, connective tissue dysplasia, hyperactivity, autistic-like and stereotypical behaviours, speech delay and increased sensory sensitivity.

Objective: To evaluate the effect of the combination of the antioxidant Ascorbic acid and tocopherol, as therapy of the Fragile X Syndrome in young males.

Hypothesis: It is proposed that part of the pathophysiology of the central nervous system in the animal model of the fragile X syndrome may be determined by oxidative stress. In addition, Fragile X patients showed a significantly low level of ascorbic acid in plasma. The biochemical characteristics of oxidative stress may be reversed in the FMR1-KO mice, by a chronic treatment with antioxidant compounds such as tocopherol or melatonin, it may also normalize several hallmarks of the Syndrome such as hyperactivity, anxiety and cognitive deficits. The normalization of the oxidative stress is proposed as a new therapeutic pathway to alleviate conditions caused by an excess of free radicals that are crucial in neurodevelopmental diseases such as autism, down syndrome and other diseases of the central nervous system.","[(33, 40, 'CONTROL', 'Placebo'), (116, 129, 'DRUG', 'Ascorbic Acid'), (134, 144, 'DRUG', 'Tocopherol'), (170, 188, 'CONDITION', 'Fragile X Syndrome'), (195, 213, 'CONDITION', 'Fragile X syndrome'), (215, 218, 'CONDITION', 'FXS'), (445, 463, 'CONDITION', 'Fragile X syndrome'), (576, 585, 'CONDITION', 'fragile X'), (846, 857, 'DRUG', 'antioxidant'), (858, 871, 'DRUG', 'Ascorbic acid'), (876, 886, 'DRUG', 'tocopherol'), (906, 924, 'CONDITION', 'Fragile X Syndrome'), (1059, 1068, 'CONDITION', 'fragile X'), (1099, 1115, 'CONDITION', 'oxidative stress'), (1130, 1139, 'CONDITION', 'Fragile X'), (1245, 1261, 'CONDITION', 'oxidative stress'), (1327, 1338, 'DRUG', 'antioxidant'), (1446, 1459, 'CONDITION', 'hyperactivity'), (1461, 1468, 'CONDITION', 'anxiety'), (1473, 1491, 'CONDITION', 'cognitive deficits'), (1518, 1534, 'CONDITION', 'oxidative stress')]","[(33, 40), (116, 129), (134, 144), (170, 188), (195, 213), (215, 218), (445, 463), (576, 585), (846, 857), (858, 871), (876, 886), (906, 924), (1059, 1068), (1099, 1115), (1130, 1139), (1245, 1261), (1327, 1338), (1446, 1459), (1461, 1468), (1473, 1491), (1518, 1534)]","[(170, 188, 'CONDITION'), (195, 213, 'CONDITION'), (215, 218, 'CONDITION'), (445, 463, 'CONDITION'), (576, 585, 'CONDITION'), (906, 924, 'CONDITION'), (1059, 1068, 'CONDITION'), (1099, 1115, 'CONDITION'), (1130, 1139, 'CONDITION'), (1245, 1261, 'CONDITION'), (1446, 1459, 'CONDITION'), (1461, 1468, 'CONDITION'), (1473, 1491, 'CONDITION'), (1518, 1534, 'CONDITION')]","[(33, 40, 'CONTROL'), (116, 129, 'DRUG'), (134, 144, 'DRUG'), (846, 857, 'DRUG'), (858, 871, 'DRUG'), (876, 886, 'DRUG'), (1327, 1338, 'DRUG')]"

The exact mechanism of SUDEP is not known. It is thought that cardiac and respiratory factors are involved. Several ways of preventing SUDEP have been identified. These include seizure control, stress reduction, physical activity, family's ability to perform CPR, and night supervision.

A mattress alarm system that monitors nocturnal seizures can alert family members of night time seizure activity. Thus, a family member could provide aid and therefore potentially avoid SUDEP. The Emfit monitor is intended to perform these tasks.

Investigators tested the Emfit mattress monitor DVM-GPRS-V2 in combination with the Emfit bed sensor L-4060SL in the epilepsy monitoring unit and were able to demonstrate that the device has a high predictive value for detection of generalized convulsions and that it can notify caregivers in the early stages of convulsive activity.

Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness. For majority of patients it is a lifetime condition,characterized by intermittent episodes of hospitalization due to relapse or acute symptom exacerbation. The nature and course of the disorder impose significant social and economic burden. Relapse is costly, with hospitalization accounting for a substantial portion of healthcare expenses. Second generation antipsychotic side effect such as metabolic syndrome and diabetes mellitus will contribute additional costs to the treatment.

Many studies have since then provided convincing evidence for a high risk of diabetes and other glucose abnormalities, metabolic syndrome and mortality due to elevated cardiovascular risk in patients with schizophrenia.

However many studies has shown the effectiveness and safety of aripiprazole and ziprazidone.In one of the study, aripiprazole showed improvement of negative schizophrenic symptoms by 25% and 50% of functioning level from baseline. In term of safety, antipsychotics considered to have a safer metabolic profile were amisulpride, ziprasidone and aripiprazole.

Study objectives:

To investigate the safety and efficacy of ziprazidone versus aripiprazole in the treatment of schizophrenia patients with metabolic syndrome and diabetes mellitus.
To investigate the reversibility of metabolic syndrome and diabetes parameters following the treatment with ziprazidone versus aripiprazole.

393,NCT01465087,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"Applications of Nanotechnology and Chemical Sensors for the Detection and Identification of Multiple Sclerosis, In Comparison to Other Autoimmune and Neurological Diseases by Exhalation Samples | Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a complex multi-factorial disease, with underlying both genetic and environmental factors. Different populations have different susceptibility to MS. The disease is characterized by 2 main phenotypes: relapsing-remitting or progressive course. Clinical disability is due to distraction of the central nervous system (CNS) myelin.

Repair processes are mainly noted after the acute relapse - and recovery of function can be spontaneous. However, in severe relapses sometimes there is need for STEROID TREATMENT.

For the long term prophylaxis - following the increased understanding of the disease, in the last 10-15 years, there are new immunotherapies available (COPAXON / TEVA; Interferon -beta). However these can attenuate the disease (reduce the number of relapses per year) but cannot cure it. Also, they are beneficial in only ~40 % of the Relapsing -Remitting patients.

Currently there are no biomarkers available for MS (other than oligoclonal Immunoglobulin G (IgG) in the cervical spine fluid (CSF) - which helps confirm diagnosis but require an invasive procedure and are not correlated with disease activity nor response to therapy) and monitoring of MS and its treatment is by magnetic resonance Imaging (MRI) - which is an expensive procedure.

Dr Hossam Haick from the Technion developed an electronic nose based on nanomaterials for diagnosis of diseases (e.g., cancer, kidney failure, etc.) via breath samples.The research hypothesis is that Biomarkers of CNS inflammation and/or neurodegeneration and/or CNS repair in persons with MS can be detected by the ""electronic nose"".","[(92, 110, 'CONDITION', 'Multiple Sclerosis'), (196, 214, 'CONDITION', 'Multiple Sclerosis'), (216, 218, 'CONDITION', 'MS'), (369, 371, 'CONDITION', 'MS'), (1150, 1152, 'CONDITION', 'MS'), (1388, 1390, 'CONDITION', 'MS'), (1774, 1776, 'CONDITION', 'MS')]","[(92, 110), (196, 214), (216, 218), (369, 371), (1150, 1152), (1388, 1390), (1774, 1776)]","[(92, 110, 'CONDITION'), (196, 214, 'CONDITION'), (216, 218, 'CONDITION'), (369, 371, 'CONDITION'), (1150, 1152, 'CONDITION'), (1388, 1390, 'CONDITION'), (1774, 1776, 'CONDITION')]",[]

395,NCT02899858,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"Restoration of Standing and Walking With ISMS in Humans | Spinal cord neural circuitry exists in the lumbar enlargement that makes it possible to stand and create synergistic, rhythmic stepping activity in the lower limbs. In the past 20 years, clinicians have tried to reengage such these circuits for standing and walking in the lower spinal cord of paralyzed humans through novel paradigms of physical therapy, pharmacological stimulation of the spinal cord, or recently - epidural stimulation of the spinal cord. Although standing and stepping with these maneuvers are rudimentary at best, these human studies offer promise to restore controlled, lower extremity movement to the spinal cord injured (SCI) individual. Evidence from animal data suggests that more focal activation of intraspinal circuitry (IntraSpinal Micro-Stimulation - ISMS) would produce more fatigue resistant, natural standing and stepping activity in humans. To date, there has been no direct confirmation of such circuitry in the spinal cord of bipedal humans who have been paralyzed. Furthermore, mapping of such circuitry would provide the basis of a novel intraspinal neuroprosthetic that should be able to restore control of standing or walking in a manner that is much more physiologically normal and tolerable than by stimulating each individual muscle group. Proof of the existence of these spinal circuits in man, and the ability to activate and control these circuits by first mapping the spinal cord is the basis of this proposal.","[(41, 45, 'OTHER', 'ISMS'), (352, 361, 'CONDITION', 'paralyzed'), (683, 702, 'CONDITION', 'spinal cord injured'), (704, 707, 'CONDITION', 'SCI'), (766, 807, 'OTHER', 'focal activation of intraspinal circuitry'), (809, 838, 'OTHER', 'IntraSpinal Micro-Stimulation'), (841, 845, 'OTHER', 'ISMS'), (1051, 1060, 'CONDITION', 'paralyzed')]","[(41, 45), (352, 361), (683, 702), (704, 707), (766, 807), (809, 838), (841, 845), (1051, 1060)]","[(352, 361, 'CONDITION'), (683, 702, 'CONDITION'), (704, 707, 'CONDITION'), (1051, 1060, 'CONDITION')]","[(41, 45, 'OTHER'), (766, 807, 'OTHER'), (809, 838, 'OTHER'), (841, 845, 'OTHER')]"
396,NCT03661411,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"Antiplatelet vs R-tPA for Acute Mild Ischemic Stroke: a Prospective, Random, Blinded Assessment of Outcome and Open Label Multi-center Study | Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is one of common diseases with significant morbidity, mortality and disability. A wide array of studies confirms that intravenous thrombolytic therapy with alteplase can effectively improve the functional prognosis in acute ischemic stroke. Thus all guidelines recommended the intravenous thrombolytic therapy with alteplase for acute ischemic stroke within 4.5 hours from stroke onset.

Minor stroke is usually defined as NIHSS score ≤ 3 or 5，although it accounts for 1/2-2/3 of AIS, the evidence of thrombolysis is insufficient. A study from Canada shows that 28.5% of patients with minor stroke who have not receive rt-pa thrombolytic therapy are unable to walk independently when discharged. Based on such a consideration,the PRISMS study further compares the efficacy and safety of thrombolytic therapy with antithrombotic therapy in patients with minor stroke. Unfortunately, the study has been early terminated due to the sponsorship reason in 2018, with only 313 cases enrolled. The preliminary results shows that there is no significant difference of the 90-day neurological function between the two groups, while the safety of the treatment group with alteplase has a higher rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. The patient receiving thrombolysis can not be given antithrombolytic therapy within 24 hours even if the patient's condition has worsened, is clinically more puzzling.

The CHANCE study in 2013 shows that the efficacy of aspirin with clopidogrel is superior to aspirin alone with minor stroke (NIHSS < 3) or TIA(ABCD2 < 4). The POINT study in 2018 further confirmed the efficacy and safety of intensive antithrombotic therapy within 12 hours of onset with minor stroke.

Based on the above discussion, this study aims to explore the efficacy and safety of aspirin with clopidogrel vs alteplase in the treatment of acute minor stroke.","[(0, 12, 'DRUG', 'Antiplatelet'), (16, 21, 'DRUG', 'R-tPA'), (26, 52, 'CONDITION', 'Acute Mild Ischemic Stroke'), (143, 164, 'CONDITION', 'Acute ischemic stroke'), (166, 169, 'CONDITION', 'AIS'), (327, 336, 'DRUG', 'alteplase'), (389, 410, 'CONDITION', 'acute ischemic stroke'), (486, 495, 'DRUG', 'alteplase'), (500, 521, 'CONDITION', 'acute ischemic stroke'), (544, 550, 'CONDITION', 'stroke'), (559, 571, 'CONDITION', 'Minor stroke'), (651, 654, 'CONDITION', 'AIS'), (756, 768, 'CONDITION', 'minor stroke'), (790, 795, 'DRUG', 'rt-pa'), (1024, 1036, 'CONDITION', 'minor stroke'), (1333, 1342, 'DRUG', 'alteplase'), (1622, 1629, 'DRUG', 'aspirin'), (1635, 1646, 'DRUG', 'clopidogrel'), (1662, 1669, 'DRUG', 'aspirin'), (1681, 1693, 'CONDITION', 'minor stroke'), (1857, 1869, 'CONDITION', 'minor stroke'), (1957, 1964, 'DRUG', 'aspirin'), (1970, 1981, 'DRUG', 'clopidogrel'), (1985, 1994, 'DRUG', 'alteplase'), (2015, 2033, 'CONDITION', 'acute minor stroke')]","[(0, 12), (16, 21), (26, 52), (143, 164), (166, 169), (327, 336), (389, 410), (486, 495), (500, 521), (544, 550), (559, 571), (651, 654), (756, 768), (790, 795), (1024, 1036), (1333, 1342), (1622, 1629), (1635, 1646), (1662, 1669), (1681, 1693), (1857, 1869), (1957, 1964), (1970, 1981), (1985, 1994), (2015, 2033)]","[(26, 52, 'CONDITION'), (143, 164, 'CONDITION'), (166, 169, 'CONDITION'), (389, 410, 'CONDITION'), (500, 521, 'CONDITION'), (544, 550, 'CONDITION'), (559, 571, 'CONDITION'), (651, 654, 'CONDITION'), (756, 768, 'CONDITION'), (1024, 1036, 'CONDITION'), (1681, 1693, 'CONDITION'), (1857, 1869, 'CONDITION'), (2015, 2033, 'CONDITION')]","[(0, 12, 'DRUG'), (16, 21, 'DRUG'), (327, 336, 'DRUG'), (486, 495, 'DRUG'), (790, 795, 'DRUG'), (1333, 1342, 'DRUG'), (1622, 1629, 'DRUG'), (1635, 1646, 'DRUG'), (1662, 1669, 'DRUG'), (1957, 1964, 'DRUG'), (1970, 1981, 'DRUG'), (1985, 1994, 'DRUG')]"
