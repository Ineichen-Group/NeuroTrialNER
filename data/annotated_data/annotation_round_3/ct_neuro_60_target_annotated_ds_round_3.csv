A possible better treatment is intensive function-oriented physical therapy or Pain Exposure in Physical Therapy (PEPT). However, there are no adequate studies performed that demonstrate the efficacy of PEPT and therefore PEPT is lacking in the Dutch CBO CRPS-1 guidelines. Despite a lacking scientific argumentation, the PEPT approach or Macedonian therapy, is now being adopted on a large scale among physical therapists in The Netherlands. There are two level C retrospective cohort studies demonstrating a promising and clinical relevant beneficial effect on pain and function after PEPT. In response to the growing demand for scientific argumentation among doctors and physical therapists with respect to the efficacy of PEPT, we conducted a pilot study at the UMC St Radboud Nijmegen.

22,NCT02249572,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"Vestibular Schwannoma - Radiosurgery or Expectation | The purpose of this study is to compare the outcome of patients with vestibular schwannomas in two groups of randomised to either radiosurgery or expectation.

The optimal treatment for a small vestibular schwannoma is a matter of controversy and there are no class 1 studies investigating this. Even the natural tumor growth rate remains controversial and is reported to be from near 100% of cases showing growth to 40-60% in various reports. The clinical results of various treatment strategies are documented, but comparative studies are very few. Immediate radiosurgery or wait-and scan with subsequent treatment upon growth are two strategies that have both been used in many different centers. There are only two studies comparing these treatment modalities .These studies indicate significant effect of GKRS in reducing tumor growth, with less differences in hearing and complaint outcomes. None of the studies are blinded or randomised, allowing for bias.

The present study aims at comparing the two modalities above. To achieve this, we intend to randomise patients with newly diagnosed VS to either of Wait-and Scan or immediate radiosurgery.

The primary study endpoint is the relative tumor size measured as the ratio between tumor volume at four years compared with volume at inclusion. Secondary endpoints include symptom and sign development measured by clinical examination and by patient's responses to standardised validated questionnaires. In addition, the health economics involved with both strategies will be evaluated and compared, as well as the patient's working status.

Patients will be asked to participate if their VS is diagnosed within the last six months, their age is between 18 and 70, and pending there are no exclusion criteria (see below). A power analysis indicates that about 50 patients per group is sufficient.

In case of failure to recruit patients, we will change the design to a study based on patient's own choice of treatment.

The study will be announced according to international guidelines. A steering committee will monitor the study and an intermediate analysis will be performed when the study group has been followed for two years. If the effect aim is already observed, the study should nonetheless continue, as it is too early to evaluate the results after such a short time course.

24,NCT02383004,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"Acupuncture for the Prevention of Emergence Delirium in Children Undergoing Myringotomy Tube Placement | Myringotomy tube placement is one of the most commonly performed operations in children. Emergence delirium after such procedures is common. During emergence delirium children can become both a danger to themselves and others around them, including family members and hospital staff.

The primary objective of this study is to determine if acupuncture, when used in combination with standard anesthetic management, decreases the incidence of emergence delirium in pediatric patients following myringotomy tube placement. Patients with and without premedication of midazolam will be included. A secondary objective of this study is to determine our institution's actual incidence of emergence delirium for this operation using a validated scale, the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) scale. We will also compare rates of emergence delirium in patients that received a premedication of midazolam versus (V) those that did not (NV).

This is a randomized double-blinded trial. We will enroll 100 children aged 1-6 years old. Premedication with midazolam will be decided by the anesthesiologist. If needed, the patient will receive a standard does of oral midazolam plus acetaminophen (V). If the patient does not require premedication with midazolam, oral acetaminophen will be given alone (NV).

Patients will then be randomized to receive either acupuncture with standard general anesthesia care (A) or to receive standard anesthetic care alone (S). Patients, their family members and recovery registered nurses (RNs) will not know if acupuncture was performed. Intraoperative anesthetic techniques will be standardized and include inhaled inductions with nitrous oxide and sevoflurane. Anesthesia maintenance will be inhaled sevoflurane and the usual pain medication ketorolac will be given intramuscularly prior to emergence. Acupuncture needles will be placed after anesthesia induction and removed prior to leaving the operating room. A total of 4 needles will be placed, one in each wrist at the Heart 7 (HT7) point and one in each ear at the Shen Men point. The needles will be inserted bilaterally to a depth of 1.8 mm.

The study uses the resources in both states including established dental centers, Joint Commission Certified Stroke Centers, the Schools of Public Health, and the Institute for Partnerships to Eliminate Health Disparities. The proposal addresses specific issues with regards to recruitment of African-American and rural stroke/TIA patients advocating the use of culturally appropriate strategies to educate the study subjects regarding stroke, periodontal disease and the periodontal stroke link.

The study proposes to utilize economic evaluation of the periodontal intervention from the budgetary perspective. The focus will be on the financial sustainability of providing aggressive periodontal therapy (with certain, although relatively low expenditures) in exchange for a reduction of uncertain recurrent vascular events that may require high cost emergency department utilization and/or inpatient care. The sustainability of the proposed intervention after the completion of the project is integrally linked to the health economic assessment to show the health care cost savings.

It can be further classified into acute and chronic, which have different pathophysiology. Acute haematoma is a common result of traumatic injuries involving the tearing of the bridging veins, while chronic subdural haematoma can be both a result of traumatic injuries or recurrence following surgical management of the acute counterpart. For symptomatic patients, they are often surgically managed by haematoma drainage via burr-hole drainage and craniotomy. Recurrent bleeding following close monitor or surgical evacuation of haematoma is however very high. Recent studies approximate the recurrence rate of 2%-33.3%. Recent evidence suggests the angiogenesis of middle meningeal arteries (MMA) in response to inflammation and healing process contributes to the development of chronic subdural haematoma, and its high recurrence chance.

Patients with newly diagnosed brain or head and neck tumors who are having radiation therapy will have neurocognitive testing and MRI imaging (both research and for regular care) done as part of their participation in the study.

Survivors of childhood brain tumors who completed radiation therapy at least two years before joining the study, and have not had a recurrence, will have neurocognitive testing and research MRIs completed.

Healthy children will also be enrolled and have research MRIs done.

The researchers will use the radiation plan to determine how much radiation was delivered to different parts of the brain. The investigators will use the MRIs to determine how the normal brain is changing after treatment; and how this compares to patients who had standard radiation treatment or who never had a brain tumor. The neurocognitive testing will be compared among different groups to see how different treatment plans affect performance on neurocognitive tests.","[(25, 71, 'OTHER', 'Brain Substructure-informed Radiation Planning'), (166, 183, 'RADIOTHERAPY', 'radiation therapy'), (253, 262, 'RADIOTHERAPY', 'radiation'), (278, 283, 'CONDITION', 'tumor'), (399, 444, 'CONDITION', 'newly diagnosed brain or head and neck tumors'), (460, 477, 'RADIOTHERAPY', 'radiation therapy'), (638, 650, 'CONDITION', 'brain tumors'), (665, 682, 'RADIOTHERAPY', 'radiation therapy'), (920, 934, 'OTHER', 'radiation plan'), (957, 966, 'RADIOTHERAPY', 'radiation'), (1155, 1183, 'CONTROL', 'standard radiation treatment'), (1203, 1214, 'CONDITION', 'brain tumor')]","[(25, 71), (166, 183), (253, 262), (278, 283), (399, 444), (460, 477), (638, 650), (665, 682), (920, 934), (957, 966), (1155, 1183), (1203, 1214)]","[(278, 283, 'CONDITION'), (399, 444, 'CONDITION'), (638, 650, 'CONDITION'), (1203, 1214, 'CONDITION')]","[(25, 71, 'OTHER'), (166, 183, 'RADIOTHERAPY'), (253, 262, 'RADIOTHERAPY'), (460, 477, 'RADIOTHERAPY'), (665, 682, 'RADIOTHERAPY'), (920, 934, 'OTHER'), (957, 966, 'RADIOTHERAPY'), (1155, 1183, 'CONTROL')]"
