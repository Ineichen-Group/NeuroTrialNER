2,NCT01544738,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"Aponeurotic Stimulation Effect on Parkinson Bradykinesia | Movement slowness (bradykinesia) is one of the main motor symptoms in Parkinson Disease (PD). Several studies have shown that patients with PD exhibit slowness because they are unable to modulate, in an optimal way, the velocity of voluntary motor acts not induced by external stimulation. Indeed, these patients have difficulties to integrate multi-sensorial information, mainly proprioception.

The investigators investigated changes in shoulder velocity during pointing movements by patients with PD after stimulation of soft tissues (aponeurosis) of upper limb muscles. The stimulation consisted of manipulating, with a hook (the diacutaneous fibrolysis method), the aponeurotic tissues enrobing the heads of the upper limb muscles. This technique has previously been shown to decrease passive tension and the tendon reflex response of the manipulated muscle group. The investigators hypothesis is that aponeurotic manipulation of shoulder muscles therefore creates a modification in the proprioceptive information, which in return temporarily decreases the bradykinesia of shoulder movements.","[(0, 23, 'OTHER', 'Aponeurotic Stimulation'), (34, 43, 'CONDITION', 'Parkinson'), (44, 56, 'CONDITION', 'Bradykinesia'), (59, 76, 'CONDITION', 'Movement slowness'), (78, 90, 'CONDITION', 'bradykinesia'), (129, 146, 'CONDITION', 'Parkinson Disease'), (148, 150, 'CONDITION', 'PD'), (199, 201, 'CONDITION', 'PD'), (559, 561, 'CONDITION', 'PD'), (568, 631, 'OTHER', 'stimulation of soft tissues (aponeurosis) of upper limb muscles'), (693, 716, 'OTHER', 'diacutaneous fibrolysis'), (966, 1010, 'OTHER', 'aponeurotic manipulation of shoulder muscles'), (1121, 1133, 'CONDITION', 'bradykinesia')]","[(0, 23), (34, 43), (44, 56), (59, 76), (78, 90), (129, 146), (148, 150), (199, 201), (559, 561), (568, 631), (693, 716), (966, 1010), (1121, 1133)]","[(34, 43, 'CONDITION'), (44, 56, 'CONDITION'), (59, 76, 'CONDITION'), (78, 90, 'CONDITION'), (129, 146, 'CONDITION'), (148, 150, 'CONDITION'), (199, 201, 'CONDITION'), (559, 561, 'CONDITION'), (1121, 1133, 'CONDITION')]","[(0, 23, 'OTHER'), (568, 631, 'OTHER'), (693, 716, 'OTHER'), (966, 1010, 'OTHER')]"

15,NCT00573612,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"Exercise-based Motivational Interviewing for Fibromyalgia | Fibromyalgia (FMS), defined as the presence of both chronic widespread pain and the finding of 11/18 tender points on examination, affects 2% of the general population. Drug therapy for FMS is largely symptomatic as there is not yet a complete understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease. In the past 17 years, supervised aerobic exercise has emerged as an important treatment modality to improve pain, aerobic capacity, function, and well-being. Individuals who are able to adhere to exercise almost always maintain the symptomatic benefits of exercise. Unfortunately, the rate of exercise adherence six months after the completion of a well-structured supervised exercise program is disappointingly low. Furthermore, although the efficacy of supervised aerobic exercise in the research setting is well documented, the applicability of such intervention in the clinic setting is doubtful. Therefore, we propose to conduct the Research to Encourage Exercise for Fibromyalgia (REEF), a randomized attention-controlled trial whose primary aim is to evaluate the efficacy of telephone-delivered motivational interviewing (MI) to encourage exercise, in improving exercise adherence and self-report physical function (co-primary outcome measures) for FMS patients. REEF will enroll 200 FMS patients, randomizing them to either the MI group or the attention-control (AC) group. Participants from each group will receive a total of 6 telephone calls within a 12-week period. Prior to the phone calls, participants from both groups will receive an individualized exercise prescription and 2 supervised exercise training sessions to get them started on an exercise program. All subjects will undergo comprehensive outcome assessment at baseline, week 12, week 24, and week 36. The secondary aim of this proposal is to determine the mediators between MI and improvement in self-report physical function. The proposed research is significant because our focus is the promotion of adherence to an exercise program, of adequate intensity, in order to maximize functioning and well-being for patients with FMS. The use of a predominantly home-based exercise program and telephone-delivered MI by a trained licensed practice nurse (LPN) could potentially make the proposed intervention more accessible to the greater majority of FMS patients. Furthermore, if proven efficacious, MI could readily be applied to other chronically painful conditions (e.g. chronic back pain).","[(0, 8, 'PHYSICAL', 'Exercise'), (15, 40, 'BEHAVIOURAL', 'Motivational Interviewing'), (45, 57, 'CONDITION', 'Fibromyalgia'), (60, 72, 'CONDITION', 'Fibromyalgia'), (74, 77, 'CONDITION', 'FMS'), (131, 135, 'CONDITION', 'pain'), (246, 249, 'CONDITION', 'FMS'), (387, 403, 'PHYSICAL', 'aerobic exercise'), (462, 466, 'CONDITION', 'pain'), (550, 558, 'PHYSICAL', 'exercise'), (610, 618, 'PHYSICAL', 'exercise'), (647, 655, 'PHYSICAL', 'exercise'), (730, 738, 'PHYSICAL', 'exercise'), (820, 836, 'PHYSICAL', 'aerobic exercise'), (1157, 1182, 'BEHAVIOURAL', 'motivational interviewing'), (1184, 1186, 'BEHAVIOURAL', 'MI'), (1201, 1209, 'PHYSICAL', 'exercise'), (1224, 1232, 'PHYSICAL', 'exercise'), (1311, 1314, 'CONDITION', 'FMS'), (1346, 1349, 'CONDITION', 'FMS'), (1391, 1393, 'BEHAVIOURAL', 'MI'), (1407, 1424, 'CONTROL', 'attention-control'), (1426, 1428, 'CONTROL', 'AC'), (1605, 1628, 'PHYSICAL', 'individualized exercise'), (1648, 1667, 'PHYSICAL', 'supervised exercise'), (1712, 1720, 'PHYSICAL', 'exercise'), (1906, 1908, 'BEHAVIOURAL', 'MI'), (2050, 2058, 'PHYSICAL', 'exercise'), (2157, 2160, 'CONDITION', 'FMS'), (2200, 2208, 'PHYSICAL', 'exercise'), (2241, 2243, 'BEHAVIOURAL', 'MI'), (2379, 2382, 'CONDITION', 'FMS'), (2429, 2431, 'BEHAVIOURAL', 'MI')]","[(0, 8), (15, 40), (45, 57), (60, 72), (74, 77), (131, 135), (246, 249), (387, 403), (462, 466), (550, 558), (610, 618), (647, 655), (730, 738), (820, 836), (1157, 1182), (1184, 1186), (1201, 1209), (1224, 1232), (1311, 1314), (1346, 1349), (1391, 1393), (1407, 1424), (1426, 1428), (1605, 1628), (1648, 1667), (1712, 1720), (1906, 1908), (2050, 2058), (2157, 2160), (2200, 2208), (2241, 2243), (2379, 2382), (2429, 2431)]","[(45, 57, 'CONDITION'), (60, 72, 'CONDITION'), (74, 77, 'CONDITION'), (131, 135, 'CONDITION'), (246, 249, 'CONDITION'), (462, 466, 'CONDITION'), (1311, 1314, 'CONDITION'), (1346, 1349, 'CONDITION'), (2157, 2160, 'CONDITION'), (2379, 2382, 'CONDITION')]","[(0, 8, 'PHYSICAL'), (15, 40, 'BEHAVIOURAL'), (387, 403, 'PHYSICAL'), (550, 558, 'PHYSICAL'), (610, 618, 'PHYSICAL'), (647, 655, 'PHYSICAL'), (730, 738, 'PHYSICAL'), (820, 836, 'PHYSICAL'), (1157, 1182, 'BEHAVIOURAL'), (1184, 1186, 'BEHAVIOURAL'), (1201, 1209, 'PHYSICAL'), (1224, 1232, 'PHYSICAL'), (1391, 1393, 'BEHAVIOURAL'), (1407, 1424, 'CONTROL'), (1426, 1428, 'CONTROL'), (1605, 1628, 'PHYSICAL'), (1648, 1667, 'PHYSICAL'), (1712, 1720, 'PHYSICAL'), (1906, 1908, 'BEHAVIOURAL'), (2050, 2058, 'PHYSICAL'), (2200, 2208, 'PHYSICAL'), (2241, 2243, 'BEHAVIOURAL'), (2429, 2431, 'BEHAVIOURAL')]"

18,NCT02068391,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"Achieving Brain Benefits in Covert Stroke Through Aerobic Exercise | Silent ischemic, also known as ""covert stroke vascular disease"" (CSVD), contributes to neurological deficits that are caused by damage to small blood vessels in the brain. CSVD occurs six to ten times more often that an acute stroke. It is misleading to think, however, that CSVD is an inevitable part of ""getting old"" because people with CSVD are at high risk of developing an acute stroke or dementia. In fact, people with more CSVD lesion volume are more likely to develop day to day problems in planning, decision-making and speed of thinking. Unfortunately, there are no proven therapies designed to address CSVD. We propose to test whether aerobic exercise is an intervention that can combat CSVD because the disease is fundamentally a blood flow problem that may be improved by aerobic exercise. We will recruit CSVD adults with moderate to severe lesion burden and use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to study the brain in terms of structure, perfusion and function. Participants will be randomly assigned to either our established aerobic exercise program or a control stretching program. Both groups will take part in lab exercise sessions, which are designed to monitor progress and assess adherence to the program. The duration and intensity of their exercise will increase as participants progress. We will use activity log books, phone calls and extra ""booster"" exercise sessions, as needed, to maximize retention and adherence. We aim to show that aerobic exercise increases cerebral blood flow (CBF) in frontal-subcortical grey matter, supports regional tissue growth, and improves cognitive function in CSVD adults with substantial risk of acute stroke and dementia. A positive outcome of this research will provide strong support for additional clinical trials aimed at sustaining cognition and maintaining independent living.","[(28, 41, 'CONDITION', 'Covert Stroke'), (50, 66, 'PHYSICAL', 'Aerobic Exercise'), (101, 131, 'CONDITION', 'covert stroke vascular disease'), (134, 138, 'CONDITION', 'CSVD'), (241, 245, 'CONDITION', 'CSVD'), (289, 301, 'CONDITION', 'acute stroke'), (344, 348, 'CONDITION', 'CSVD'), (408, 412, 'CONDITION', 'CSVD'), (447, 459, 'CONDITION', 'acute stroke'), (499, 503, 'CONDITION', 'CSVD'), (682, 686, 'CONDITION', 'CSVD'), (715, 731, 'PHYSICAL', 'aerobic exercise'), (767, 771, 'CONDITION', 'CSVD'), (854, 870, 'PHYSICAL', 'aerobic exercise'), (888, 892, 'CONDITION', 'CSVD'), (1110, 1134, 'PHYSICAL', 'aerobic exercise program'), (1140, 1166, 'CONTROL', 'control stretching program'), (1333, 1341, 'PHYSICAL', 'exercise'), (1430, 1463, 'PHYSICAL', 'extra ""booster"" exercise sessions'), (1533, 1549, 'PHYSICAL', 'aerobic exercise'), (1690, 1694, 'CONDITION', 'CSVD'), (1727, 1739, 'CONDITION', 'acute stroke')]","[(28, 41), (50, 66), (101, 131), (134, 138), (241, 245), (289, 301), (344, 348), (408, 412), (447, 459), (499, 503), (682, 686), (715, 731), (767, 771), (854, 870), (888, 892), (1110, 1134), (1140, 1166), (1333, 1341), (1430, 1463), (1533, 1549), (1690, 1694), (1727, 1739)]","[(28, 41, 'CONDITION'), (101, 131, 'CONDITION'), (134, 138, 'CONDITION'), (241, 245, 'CONDITION'), (289, 301, 'CONDITION'), (344, 348, 'CONDITION'), (408, 412, 'CONDITION'), (447, 459, 'CONDITION'), (499, 503, 'CONDITION'), (682, 686, 'CONDITION'), (767, 771, 'CONDITION'), (888, 892, 'CONDITION'), (1690, 1694, 'CONDITION'), (1727, 1739, 'CONDITION')]","[(50, 66, 'PHYSICAL'), (715, 731, 'PHYSICAL'), (854, 870, 'PHYSICAL'), (1110, 1134, 'PHYSICAL'), (1140, 1166, 'CONTROL'), (1333, 1341, 'PHYSICAL'), (1430, 1463, 'PHYSICAL'), (1533, 1549, 'PHYSICAL')]"

47,NCT03506906,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"The Debated Role of Sleep Studies in Patients Under Established Home Mechanical Ventilation | Patients suffering chronic hypercapnic respiratory insufficiency (e.g. in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obesity hypoventilation syndrome) benefit from home mechanical ventilation. These patients are complex; and the ventilator´s parameters should be set-up according to the underlying disease and particular patient's characteristics. The non-invasive ventilation therapy is mostly titrated while the patient is awake, hence Problems, such as Patient-Ventilator asynchrony, arising while sleeping on the ventilator therapy would remain undetected.

Sleep studies, such as polysomnography or polygraphy and transcutaneous carbon dioxide monitoring could be valuable tools to fine-tune the ventilator's settings. This could foster the ventilator´s effectivity and patient satisfaction, thus therapy's adherence. Nevertheless the sleep studies are expensive, time-consuming and not widely available.

The aim of this study is to learn the findings of sleep studies when they are performed on stable patients on home mechanical ventilation as part of their routine check-ups. In this context, it will be assessed whether the sleep studies' findings lead to a change (adjustment) of the ventilator´s therapy. Moreover, this study aims to investigate whether the absence of sleep studies would result in missing important events that require an adjustment of therapy.

59,NCT01841840,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"The Acute Effects of Passive Vibration on Cardiovascular Function in Individuals With Stroke | Stroke is the third leading cause of death in the United States. Of those who are affected by stroke, a third becomes permanently disabled. Risk factors for stroke include, but are not limited to, advancing age, physical inactivity, arterial stiffness, and most commonly, high blood pressure. Stroke is a major form of a much boarder problem, cardiovascular disease (CVD). CVD is considered the primary cause of death in the US. Interestingly, increased arterial stiffness of elastic arteries (carotid and aorta) has been shown to be strongly correlated to CVD and stroke. Increased arterial stiffness is considered an independent risk for the development of CVD and stroke. Hence, arterial stiffness has been suggested as a potential therapeutic target for CVD and more specifically stroke.

Recently, whole-body vibration (WBV) exercise has been proposed as a new and effective method to improve muscle mass and muscle strength in younger and older individuals. It is known that systemic arterial stiffness decreased 40 min after a single WBV session in healthy men. In our laboratory, we have shown that leg arterial stiffness decreases after a session of WBV. Taken together, this data seems to suggest WBV may be used as a viable way to decrease arterial stiffness. Special populations, such as post-stroke patients, may be unwilling or unable to perform WBV exercise so an inactive form of exercise (vibration) therapy is needed.

Passive vibration (PV), allows patients to lie in an inactive, supine position, with their legs placed onto the vibration plate. This exposes the lower limbs to continuous vibration without performing voluntary muscle contraction. PV has been shown to increase skin blood flow on the vibrated extremity through vasodilation in healthy individuals and type 2 diabetics. Previous work in our laboratory has demonstrated that a 10-min session of PV on the legs decreases augmentation index (AIx) , a marker of pressure wave reflection, as well as leg and systemic PWV through decreases in local peripheral resistance in young men. However, the effects of PV on arterial function in post-stroke patients are unknown.

It is hypothesized that post-stroke patients will demonstrate a decrease in leg PWV and central AIx. However, greater responses are expected with the lower vibration frequency.","[(21, 38, 'OTHER', 'Passive Vibration'), (86, 92, 'CONDITION', 'Stroke'), (95, 101, 'CONDITION', 'Stroke'), (189, 195, 'CONDITION', 'stroke'), (252, 258, 'CONDITION', 'stroke'), (388, 394, 'CONDITION', 'Stroke'), (438, 460, 'CONDITION', 'cardiovascular disease'), (462, 465, 'CONDITION', 'CVD'), (468, 471, 'CONDITION', 'CVD'), (539, 587, 'CONDITION', 'increased arterial stiffness of elastic arteries'), (652, 655, 'CONDITION', 'CVD'), (660, 666, 'CONDITION', 'stroke'), (668, 696, 'CONDITION', 'Increased arterial stiffness'), (754, 757, 'CONDITION', 'CVD'), (762, 768, 'CONDITION', 'stroke'), (777, 795, 'CONDITION', 'arterial stiffness'), (853, 856, 'CONDITION', 'CVD'), (879, 885, 'CONDITION', 'stroke'), (1076, 1103, 'CONDITION', 'systemic arterial stiffness'), (1206, 1224, 'CONDITION', 'arterial stiffness'), (1346, 1364, 'CONDITION', 'arterial stiffness'), (1400, 1406, 'CONDITION', 'stroke'), (1532, 1549, 'PHYSICAL', 'Passive vibration'), (1551, 1553, 'PHYSICAL', 'PV'), (1693, 1713, 'PHYSICAL', 'continuous vibration'), (1763, 1765, 'PHYSICAL', 'PV'), (1975, 1977, 'PHYSICAL', 'PV'), (2076, 2096, 'PHYSICAL', 'leg and systemic PWV'), (2184, 2186, 'PHYSICAL', 'PV'), (2216, 2222, 'CONDITION', 'stroke'), (2275, 2281, 'CONDITION', 'stroke'), (2322, 2329, 'PHYSICAL', 'leg PWV')]","[(21, 38), (86, 92), (95, 101), (189, 195), (252, 258), (388, 394), (438, 460), (462, 465), (468, 471), (539, 587), (652, 655), (660, 666), (668, 696), (754, 757), (762, 768), (777, 795), (853, 856), (879, 885), (1076, 1103), (1206, 1224), (1346, 1364), (1400, 1406), (1532, 1549), (1551, 1553), (1693, 1713), (1763, 1765), (1975, 1977), (2076, 2096), (2184, 2186), (2216, 2222), (2275, 2281), (2322, 2329)]","[(86, 92, 'CONDITION'), (95, 101, 'CONDITION'), (189, 195, 'CONDITION'), (252, 258, 'CONDITION'), (388, 394, 'CONDITION'), (438, 460, 'CONDITION'), (462, 465, 'CONDITION'), (468, 471, 'CONDITION'), (539, 587, 'CONDITION'), (652, 655, 'CONDITION'), (660, 666, 'CONDITION'), (668, 696, 'CONDITION'), (754, 757, 'CONDITION'), (762, 768, 'CONDITION'), (777, 795, 'CONDITION'), (853, 856, 'CONDITION'), (879, 885, 'CONDITION'), (1076, 1103, 'CONDITION'), (1206, 1224, 'CONDITION'), (1346, 1364, 'CONDITION'), (1400, 1406, 'CONDITION'), (2216, 2222, 'CONDITION'), (2275, 2281, 'CONDITION')]","[(21, 38, 'OTHER'), (1532, 1549, 'PHYSICAL'), (1551, 1553, 'PHYSICAL'), (1693, 1713, 'PHYSICAL'), (1763, 1765, 'PHYSICAL'), (1975, 1977, 'PHYSICAL'), (2076, 2096, 'PHYSICAL'), (2184, 2186, 'PHYSICAL'), (2322, 2329, 'PHYSICAL')]"

Also, patients affected by Sarcoidosis usually experience a state of physical and mental weariness called fatigue and reported in approximately 60-80% sarcoid patients and thought to be a consequence of inflammatory mediators but the high prevalence of OSAS could be a remarkable bias in clinical evaluation because fatigue is also strongly associated with sleep disorders.

66,NCT02118701,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"SHARED DECISION MAKING ON A 'LIFE-AND-CARE PLAN' IN LONG-TERM CARE FACILITIES | Shared Decision Making (SDM) is defined as a process where healthcare professionals and patients make decisions together, using the best available evidence. SDM, as a communication and decision method, can be used also with persons suffering from dementia. Yet, SDM with persons with dementia or even with their family caregivers is not widespread.

The present research project aims to develop and evaluate an SDM framework in care planning to be implemented in long-term care facilities, in order to obtain a constantly developing care plan that focuses not only on the medical, physical, psychosocial and spiritual needs of the resident, but that considers and documents his preferences and the actions taken by caregivers to meet them.

The current project is a controlled exploratory study. Case studies that involve a triad in each case, composed by the resident with moderate or severe dementia, his family caregiver and the professional usually taking care for the resident, will be used (n=16 professionals; n=40 residents; n=40 family caregivers). Professional caregivers of two nursing homes, one located in Italy and one in the Netherlands, will receive a specific training in SDM principles and will guide the SDM interview within the triad. Primary outcome will be the proportion of residents whose preferences and needs, together with the related actions to meet them, are known, documented and satisfied in their 'life-and-care plans'. Secondary outcomes are the residents' and family caregivers' quality of life; the family caregivers' sense of competence and the healthcare professionals' job satisfaction. Semi-structured interviews and focus group interviews will be performed to assess satisfaction with the intervention and barriers and facilitators to its implementation. Assessments are performed at baseline and six months after the intervention.

We hypothesize that the use of the SDM process in care planning will increase the number of met needs and will improve the residents' and family caregivers quality of life, the family caregivers' sense of competence and the healthcare professionals' job satisfaction.

The present study aims to identify the mechanisms underlying the deficit in facial emotion recognition reported both in schizophrenia and the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, and thus, reveal a distinction between the two disorders. Indeed, despite the clinical overlap between the two syndromes, some of the symptoms appear to be specific to only one of them. In particular, the disturbance of visual functions is specifically observed in the 22q11.2DS. Hence, the difficulties in facial emotion recognition in schizophrenia and in the 22q11.DS are likely accounted by different cognitive impairments. Investigating which mechanisms are disturbed would allow a specialized support for patients.

Our main hypothesis is that the deficit in facial emotion recognition is more related to visual impairments in the 22q11.2DS than in schizophrenia. This hypothesis will be tested in two groups of patients (22q11.2DS and schizophrenic patients) and a control group (healthy subjects) using an experimental paradigm based on electroencephalography (EEG).

A second aim of this study is to determine whether the severity of the two disorders' symptoms is correlated with the cerebral response to facial expressions.

The AMEND Sub-study | Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), central sleep apnea (CSA) and heart failure (HF) are states of metabolic demand and sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activation. In patients with sleep apnea and HF, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) initially may reduce left ventricular (LV)stroke volume (SV) but subsequently improves and LV function. This may relate to an early beneficial effect on myocardial energetics through early reduction in metabolic demand that subsequently leads to improved efficiency of LV contraction. However, it is not clear whether long-term adaptive servo-ventilation (ASV) favorably affects cardiac energetics. Any such benefit may also relate to reduced sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activation. However its effect on myocardial SNS function is also not well studied.

In a pilot study we demonstrated early (6 week) beneficial effects of CPAP in patients with OSA and HF. The current proposal (AMEND) is a unique substudy of the recently funded ADVENT-HF trial (Adaptive Servo Ventilation for Therapy of Sleep Apnea in HeartFailure) (NCT01128816; CIHR; D. Bradley, PI).

We propose to evaluate the long-term (6 month) effects of ASV on daytime 1) oxidative metabolism; 2) the work metabolic index (WMI) as an estimate of mechanical efficiency; 3) myocardial sympathetic nerve (SN) pre-synaptic function; and 4) heart rate (HR) variability in patients with HF and coexisting OSA or CSA. In conjunction with echocardiographic measures of LV stroke work, positron emission tomography (PET) derived [11C] acetate kinetics will be used as a measure of oxidative metabolism, to determine the WMI. [11C] hydroxyephedrine (HED) retention will be used to measure cardiac SN pre-synaptic function.

A potential solution to this problem is using new technology like virtual reality during walking training to make stroke survivors have a better sense of their asymmetry. A second problem that we aim to address in this study is whether asymmetry is accurately felt by the stroke survivors and how we can address it. Our ongoing work on the effects of virtual reality on learning new walking tasks in stroke survivors indicates that virtual reality maybe particularly important for those with walking asymmetry. In this study, we plan to recruit stroke survivors who have such asymmetries during walking and have them learn a new walking task in virtual reality.

There is compelling evidence that poor response inhibition is a core cognitive feature of OCD and its related disorders, but no effective intervention exists that directly attempts to address this problematic cognitive deficiency. This study will examine the feasibility and clinical utility of a computerized cognitive training program designed to improve response inhibition among individuals diagnosed with OCD or trichotillomania.This training program offers systematic practice of response inhibition in the form of a 40-level computer game. Individuals with these conditions will be randomized to either 8 sessions of (a) computerized response inhibition training (RIT) or (b) placebo computer training (PLT). We hypothesize that RIT will outperform PLT in improving response inhibition capabilities and reducing relevant clinical symptoms. In sum, this project is expected to generate important knowledge to guide the development of effective computer-based treatment approaches that may help reduce critical problems of existing treatments such as suboptimal patient retention and treatment under-utilization, thereby improving overall treatment response rates among individuals suffering from OCD and related conditions.","[(21, 49, 'BEHAVIOURAL', 'Response Inhibition Training'), (72, 114, 'CONDITION', 'Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders'), (119, 135, 'CONDITION', 'Trichotillomania'), (138, 167, 'CONDITION', 'Obsessive-compulsive disorder'), (169, 172, 'CONDITION', 'OCD'), (207, 223, 'CONDITION', 'trichotillomania'), (409, 412, 'CONDITION', 'OCD'), (528, 548, 'CONDITION', 'cognitive deficiency'), (616, 655, 'BEHAVIOURAL', 'computerized cognitive training program'), (729, 732, 'CONDITION', 'OCD'), (736, 752, 'CONDITION', 'trichotillomania'), (782, 824, 'BEHAVIOURAL', 'systematic practice of response inhibition'), (842, 864, 'BEHAVIOURAL', '40-level computer game'), (947, 988, 'BEHAVIOURAL', 'computerized response inhibition training'), (990, 993, 'BEHAVIOURAL', 'RIT'), (1002, 1027, 'CONTROL', 'placebo computer training'), (1029, 1032, 'CONTROL', 'PLT'), (1055, 1058, 'BEHAVIOURAL', 'RIT'), (1075, 1078, 'CONTROL', 'PLT'), (1521, 1524, 'CONDITION', 'OCD')]","[(21, 49), (72, 114), (119, 135), (138, 167), (169, 172), (207, 223), (409, 412), (528, 548), (616, 655), (729, 732), (736, 752), (782, 824), (842, 864), (947, 988), (990, 993), (1002, 1027), (1029, 1032), (1055, 1058), (1075, 1078), (1521, 1524)]","[(72, 114, 'CONDITION'), (119, 135, 'CONDITION'), (138, 167, 'CONDITION'), (169, 172, 'CONDITION'), (207, 223, 'CONDITION'), (409, 412, 'CONDITION'), (528, 548, 'CONDITION'), (729, 732, 'CONDITION'), (736, 752, 'CONDITION'), (1521, 1524, 'CONDITION')]","[(21, 49, 'BEHAVIOURAL'), (616, 655, 'BEHAVIOURAL'), (782, 824, 'BEHAVIOURAL'), (842, 864, 'BEHAVIOURAL'), (947, 988, 'BEHAVIOURAL'), (990, 993, 'BEHAVIOURAL'), (1002, 1027, 'CONTROL'), (1029, 1032, 'CONTROL'), (1055, 1058, 'BEHAVIOURAL'), (1075, 1078, 'CONTROL')]"

The SGLT2 is expressed in the proximal tubule and reabsorbs approximately 90 percent of the filtered glucose. The inhibition of SGLT2 results in renal excretion of glucose with subsequent osmotic diuresis. This mechanism could result in a therapeutic effect in patients with hypotonic hyponatremia as in the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion (SIAD). Because patients with SIAD usually have several comorbidities and different medications, studies investigating the physiological effects are difficult to interpret.

The temporal lobe has long been established as a region of interest in the speech perception and processing literature because it contains the auditory cortex. More recently, research has localized the supratemporal plane as an area that exhibits response specificity to acoustic properties of complex auditory signals like speech. The supratemporal plane, comprised of Heschl's gyrus, the planum polare, and the planum temporale, is capable of the rapid spectrotemporal analysis required to map acoustic information to linguistic representation. Neural activity in this area, however, is rarely studied directly because it is difficult to access with non-invasive measures like scalp electroencephalography (EEG). Capitalizing on the unique opportunity to access these areas via routine clinical stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) in a patient population, this study seeks to understand how cortical responses reflect the diagnosticity of two acoustic-phonetic dimensions of interest and how responses rapidly and flexibly adapt to changes in listening demands. Examining how neural response to voice onset time (VOT) and fundamental frequency (F0) modulates as a function of perceptual weight carried in signaling phoneme categories, and identifying how changes in listening context shift perceptual weight, will provide invaluable data that indicates how speech processing flexibly adapts to short-term acoustic patterns.",[],[],[],[]

However, approximately one third of them will lose it in next 6 months after cochlear implantation. Although the mechanisms involved in the residual audition loss remain unknown, animal experiments suggest the role of inflammatory or immune reaction in the cochlea. The goal of this project is to search in the perilymph (a fluid which fills the scala vestibuli and scala tympani of the cochlea) some predictive biomarkers of the residual hearing loss using modern proteomics and immunological techniques. A parallel search for blood biomarkers of post-implantation residual hearing loss and for molecular and cellular evidences of immune response to cochlear implantation will be performed.

123,NCT05148247,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"Evaluation of The Perceive, Recall, Plan and Perform Intervention for Persons With Cognitive Impairments After Brain Injuries in Community Rehabilitation: Single Case Experimental Study | Background: There is a need for standardized interventions in community rehabilitation that can improve everyday task performance for older adults with cognitive challenges after acquired brain injury. Older adults are often excluded from research due to strict inclusion criteria. It is critical for a sustainable health service system that these patients are empowered and reach their maximum level of independence. The Perceive, Recall, Plan and Perform System (PRPP) of Intervention can be applied by Occupational Therapists (OT) for clients with cognitive challenges to enhance mastery of needed or desired everyday tasks. There is no current evidence for the effectiveness of this intervention for this population.

Purpose: A clinical trial to investigate the effectiveness of the PRPP intervention for older persons with cognitive impairments after brain injury in the context of community-based rehabilitation.

Method: In PRPP intervention the OT uses systematically instructions in task training to support a client to use cognitive strategies efficiently. The everyday tasks used for training should be valued by the participant and useful in their rehabilitation. The tasks could include different parts of morning routines, simple or complex meal planning or preparation, use of cell phone, leisure activities, or other household and community activities. At best the skills are generalized throughout all everyday activities, and the OTs' role as a cognitive mediator fades as participants internalize the strategies. The participants receive PRPP intervention 3 times a week for 3 weeks, every session last for 45-60 minutes.

The participants' task mastery and cognitive strategy use will be measured at least 5 times in each phase: baseline, intervention, after the intervention, and 4 weeks after the discharge from rehabilitation. The measurement scores at baseline act controls and are therefore compared with the other phases for the same participant. The same procedure will be repeated for the other participants, but then with a staggered intervention phase. A staggered intervention phase acts as a control between participants and allows to see if changes occur only when the intervention is introduced.

Implications for practice: The investigators assume that this systematic intervention will improve everyday task performance, and will in turn contribute to empowerment and independence of older adults with cognitive challenges after brain injuries.","[(18, 65, 'BEHAVIOURAL', 'Perceive, Recall, Plan and Perform Intervention'), (83, 104, 'CONDITION', 'Cognitive Impairments'), (111, 125, 'CONDITION', 'Brain Injuries'), (129, 153, 'BEHAVIOURAL', 'Community Rehabilitation'), (250, 274, 'BEHAVIOURAL', 'community rehabilitation'), (340, 360, 'CONDITION', 'cognitive challenges'), (376, 388, 'CONDITION', 'brain injury'), (610, 651, 'BEHAVIOURAL', 'Perceive, Recall, Plan and Perform System'), (653, 657, 'BEHAVIOURAL', 'PRPP'), (739, 759, 'CONDITION', 'cognitive challenges'), (976, 980, 'BEHAVIOURAL', 'PRPP'), (1017, 1038, 'CONDITION', 'cognitive impairments'), (1045, 1057, 'CONDITION', 'brain injury'), (1076, 1106, 'BEHAVIOURAL', 'community-based rehabilitation'), (1120, 1124, 'BEHAVIOURAL', 'PRPP'), (1746, 1750, 'BEHAVIOURAL', 'PRPP'), (2242, 2264, 'CONTROL', 'staggered intervention'), (2274, 2296, 'CONTROL', 'staggered intervention'), (2627, 2647, 'CONDITION', 'cognitive challenges'), (2654, 2668, 'CONDITION', 'brain injuries')]","[(18, 65), (83, 104), (111, 125), (129, 153), (250, 274), (340, 360), (376, 388), (610, 651), (653, 657), (739, 759), (976, 980), (1017, 1038), (1045, 1057), (1076, 1106), (1120, 1124), (1746, 1750), (2242, 2264), (2274, 2296), (2627, 2647), (2654, 2668)]","[(83, 104, 'CONDITION'), (111, 125, 'CONDITION'), (340, 360, 'CONDITION'), (376, 388, 'CONDITION'), (739, 759, 'CONDITION'), (1017, 1038, 'CONDITION'), (1045, 1057, 'CONDITION'), (2627, 2647, 'CONDITION'), (2654, 2668, 'CONDITION')]","[(18, 65, 'BEHAVIOURAL'), (129, 153, 'BEHAVIOURAL'), (250, 274, 'BEHAVIOURAL'), (610, 651, 'BEHAVIOURAL'), (653, 657, 'BEHAVIOURAL'), (976, 980, 'BEHAVIOURAL'), (1076, 1106, 'BEHAVIOURAL'), (1120, 1124, 'BEHAVIOURAL'), (1746, 1750, 'BEHAVIOURAL'), (2242, 2264, 'CONTROL'), (2274, 2296, 'CONTROL')]"

125,NCT02337114,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"REACT - Recovery Enhancement From TBI Using ACT. A Pilot Study. | Is Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) feasible and acceptable for adults with severe Traumatic Brain Injury (sTBI) in inpatient services? sTBI is associated with depression, anxiety and low self awareness. A key factor in recovery is adjustment to the effects of injury. Psychological intervention may facilitate this change; however what works is unclear. ACT seeks to improve psychological flexibility; the ability to be present with difficult thoughts and emotions, rather than fighting them, and to accept ourselves as we are, not what we believe we should be. Current research is limited, but what is published suggests it may be useful for this group.

Due to the limited research this pilot study aims to conduct preliminary analysis on the acceptability and feasibility of ACT for people with sTBI whilst also examining the suitability of the study protocol in order to make recommendations for future studies. Clients and staff from three Brain Injury Rehabilitation Trust (BIRT) centres will be recruited, one of which will serve as the intervention centre.

Clients in the intervention group will be asked to complete questionnaires a week before and after participation in the 6 week ACT programme. Clients in the comparison group will be asked to complete questionnaires a week before and after receiving 6 weeks of treatment as usual (TAU). The treatment group will also receive TAU. All participants will be invited to participate in a focus group at the end of this 8 week period to discuss their involvement in the study.

140,NCT05183152,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"Non-invasive Brain-computer Interfaces for Control of Assistive Devices | A brain-computer interface (BCI) decodes users' behavioral intentions or mental states directly from their brain activity, thus allowing operation of devices without requiring any overt motor action. One major modality for BCI control is based on motor imagery (MI), which is the mental rehearsal of the kinesthetics of a movement without actually performing it. MI-based BCIs translate motor intents into control commands for external devices. A major challenge in such BCIs is differentiating MI patterns corresponding to fine hand movements of the same limb from non-invasive EEG recordings with low spatial resolution since the cortical sources responsible for these movements are overlapping. In this study, the investigators hypothesize that neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) applied contingent to the voluntary activation of the primary motor cortex through MI can help differentiate patterns of activity associated with different hand movements of the same limb by consistently recruiting the separate neural pathways associated with each of the movements within a closed-loop BCI setup. This is expected to be associated with neuroplastic changes at the cortical or corticospinal levels.","[(13, 38, 'OTHER', 'Brain-computer Interfaces'), (54, 71, 'OTHER', 'Assistive Devices'), (76, 100, 'OTHER', 'brain-computer interface'), (102, 105, 'OTHER', 'BCI'), (297, 300, 'OTHER', 'BCI'), (321, 334, 'OTHER', 'motor imagery'), (336, 338, 'OTHER', 'MI'), (437, 450, 'OTHER', 'MI-based BCIs'), (545, 549, 'OTHER', 'BCIs'), (569, 571, 'OTHER', 'MI'), (822, 858, 'OTHER', 'neuromuscular electrical stimulation'), (860, 864, 'OTHER', 'NMES'), (949, 951, 'OTHER', 'MI'), (1157, 1172, 'OTHER', 'closed-loop BCI')]","[(13, 38), (54, 71), (76, 100), (102, 105), (297, 300), (321, 334), (336, 338), (437, 450), (545, 549), (569, 571), (822, 858), (860, 864), (949, 951), (1157, 1172)]",[],"[(13, 38, 'OTHER'), (54, 71, 'OTHER'), (76, 100, 'OTHER'), (102, 105, 'OTHER'), (297, 300, 'OTHER'), (321, 334, 'OTHER'), (336, 338, 'OTHER'), (437, 450, 'OTHER'), (545, 549, 'OTHER'), (569, 571, 'OTHER'), (822, 858, 'OTHER'), (860, 864, 'OTHER'), (949, 951, 'OTHER'), (1157, 1172, 'OTHER')]"
141,NCT00506259,OfficialTitle+BriefSummary,"A Phase One Treatment Trial of the Circadian Sleep Disturbance in Smith-Magenis Syndrome (SMS) | This study will examine the effect of bright light or melatonin treatment on sleep in children with Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS), a genetic disorder characterized by certain physical, behavioral and developmental features. Patients have a disrupted sleep cycle involving early waking, frequent daytime napping and frequent nighttime awakenings. Melatonin is a hormone normally produced at night in healthy people. People with SMS produce high levels of melatonin during the daytime and very low levels at night. This may affect their behavior, mood, attention span and sleep patterns.

Healthy volunteers between 18 and 45 years of age and children with SMS who are between 3 and 16 years of age may be eligible for this study.

Healthy subjects are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center overnight. In the morning they take one dose of time-release melatonin and have blood and saliva samples collected hourly from 7:00 AM to 6:00 PM.

Children with SMS participate in a 2-part study, as follows:

Part 1 Inpatient Trial

Pre-trial at-home phase: During the month before NIH inpatient admission, participants do the following:

Wear an actiwatch device or keep a daily sleep diary to monitor daytime alertness, mood shifts and sleep patterns.
Complete a behavior assessment survey related to the child s behaviors and sleep patterns.
Obtain frequent body temperature measurements.
Collect several saliva samples over a 24-hour period.

NIH admission phase:

Children are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for 2-3 nights for bright light treatment. They remain in their rooms for alternating periods of exposure to standard dim room light and bright light, using a light box placed within 3 to 5 feet of the child. An electroencephalogram (EEG) with additional electrodes to track eye movements is used to monitor the child s attention. Between 8AM and 6PM serial blood samples are collected to measure melatonin levels. A parent rates the child s mood and behavior during the 2-day test period.
Children are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for 2-3 nights for melatonin treatment. They take a single dose of melatonin or placebo tablet at bedtime. During the daytime, EEG electrodes are placed to track eye movements. Between 7 PM and 7 AM serial blood samples are collected to measure melatonin levels. A parent rates the child s behavior and mood as described for the bright light study.
Children may receive either or both of the bright light and melatonin treatments.

Part 2 Outpatient Trial

Children participate in a combined bright light with melatonin trial at home. They undergo the same procedures outlined in the pre-trial at-home phase of Part 1 (actiwatch, behavior assessments, body temperature measurements, saliva samples) over an 11-week period. If saliva samples cannot be collected for melatonin testing, 24-hour urine samples may be collected instead.","[(35, 62, 'CONDITION', 'Circadian Sleep Disturbance'), (66, 88, 'CONDITION', 'Smith-Magenis Syndrome'), (90, 93, 'CONDITION', 'SMS'), (135, 147, 'OTHER', 'bright light'), (151, 160, 'DRUG', 'melatonin'), (197, 219, 'CONDITION', 'Smith-Magenis syndrome'), (221, 224, 'CONDITION', 'SMS'), (336, 357, 'CONDITION', 'disrupted sleep cycle'), (442, 451, 'DRUG', 'Melatonin'), (523, 526, 'CONDITION', 'SMS'), (550, 559, 'DRUG', 'melatonin'), (751, 754, 'CONDITION', 'SMS'), (944, 953, 'DRUG', 'melatonin'), (1045, 1048, 'CONDITION', 'SMS'), (1621, 1643, 'OTHER', 'bright light treatment'), (1739, 1751, 'OTHER', 'bright light'), (1999, 2008, 'DRUG', 'melatonin'), (2160, 2169, 'DRUG', 'melatonin'), (2208, 2217, 'DRUG', 'melatonin'), (2221, 2228, 'CONTROL', 'placebo'), (2386, 2395, 'DRUG', 'melatonin'), (2533, 2545, 'OTHER', 'bright light'), (2550, 2559, 'DRUG', 'melatonin'), (2633, 2645, 'OTHER', 'bright light'), (2651, 2660, 'DRUG', 'melatonin'), (2906, 2915, 'DRUG', 'melatonin')]","[(35, 62), (66, 88), (90, 93), (135, 147), (151, 160), (197, 219), (221, 224), (336, 357), (442, 451), (523, 526), (550, 559), (751, 754), (944, 953), (1045, 1048), (1621, 1643), (1739, 1751), (1999, 2008), (2160, 2169), (2208, 2217), (2221, 2228), (2386, 2395), (2533, 2545), (2550, 2559), (2633, 2645), (2651, 2660), (2906, 2915)]","[(35, 62, 'CONDITION'), (66, 88, 'CONDITION'), (90, 93, 'CONDITION'), (197, 219, 'CONDITION'), (221, 224, 'CONDITION'), (336, 357, 'CONDITION'), (523, 526, 'CONDITION'), (751, 754, 'CONDITION'), (1045, 1048, 'CONDITION')]","[(135, 147, 'OTHER'), (151, 160, 'DRUG'), (442, 451, 'DRUG'), (550, 559, 'DRUG'), (944, 953, 'DRUG'), (1621, 1643, 'OTHER'), (1739, 1751, 'OTHER'), (1999, 2008, 'DRUG'), (2160, 2169, 'DRUG'), (2208, 2217, 'DRUG'), (2221, 2228, 'CONTROL'), (2386, 2395, 'DRUG'), (2533, 2545, 'OTHER'), (2550, 2559, 'DRUG'), (2633, 2645, 'OTHER'), (2651, 2660, 'DRUG'), (2906, 2915, 'DRUG')]"
