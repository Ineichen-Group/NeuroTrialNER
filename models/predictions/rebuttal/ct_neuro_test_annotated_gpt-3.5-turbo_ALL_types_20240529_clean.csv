Physical activity is important for persons with disabilities to maintain physical function. A lack of physical activity can contribute to heart disease, osteoporosis, obesity, and diabetes. At the moment, the best way for people with MS to exercise and be physical activity is unknown. People with MS report is a barrier to exercise.| study is to contribute evidence for the role of targeted exercise in altering MS outcomes over time. a randomized controlled trial (RCT). to what extent does an MS Tailored Exercise Program (MSTEP) result in greater improvements in exercise capacity and related outcomes in comparison to a program based on general guidelines for exercise among people with MS who are sedentary and wish to engage in exercise as part of MS self-management. question is exercise capacity measured using cycle ergometry. However exercise efficiency, functional ambulation, strength, components of quality of life including frequency and intensity of fatigue symptoms, mood, global physical function, health perception, and illness intrusiveness, will also be measured as components of a global response outcome. is that MSTEP will result in a greater proportion of people making clinically relevant gains (at least 10% change) in exercise capacity than with general guidelines after 12 months of intervention; a secondary hypothesis is that, while there may be some decline in exercise capacity among individuals from end of intervention to follow-up one year later, the decline will be greater in the general guideline group augmenting the difference between groups in the proportion making 10% change from study entry to 24 months. In other words, gains will be maintained more for the MSTEP group over the general guideline group.|An exploratory hypothesis is that more of the targeted outcomes will improve with the MSTEP program than the general guideline approach. An explanatory hypothesis is that these gains will be accompanied by reports of greater exercise enjoyment and exercise self-efficacy (confidence) with the MSTEP program than with the general guideline program leading to more consistent exercise engagement and improved long-term adherence",targeted exercise|illness intrusiveness|exercise enjoyment|functional ambulation|fatigue symptoms|strength|health perception|quality of life|exercise capacity|exercise efficiency|ms tailored exercise program (mstep)|exercise self-efficacy|mood|global physical function|general guidelines for exercise,none,none,program based on general guidelines for exercise|ms tailored exercise program (mstep),none,program based on general guidelines for exercise|ms tailored exercise program (mstep),obesity|diabetes|multiple sclerosis|osteoporosis|heart disease|none,ms|mstep|multiple sclerosis|exercise,illness intrusiveness|intensity of fatigue symptoms|functional ambulation|fatigue symptoms|multiple sclerosis|health perception|strength|exercise capacity|frequency of fatigue symptoms|exercise efficiency|mood|global physical function,none

50,149,NCT02139436,"Hybrid-FES Exercise to Prevent Cardiovascular Declines in Acute SCI | Each year, 11,000 people suffer a spinal cord injury (SCI) in the U.S. Within the first year, there are profound declines in physiologic function, forming the underlying substrate for future cardiovascular disease . In fact, acquired cardiovascular disease is an increasingly recognized consequence of SCI and is the leading cause of death in SCI. Though incompletely understood, the almost 10-fold prevalence of cardiovascular disease results in part from profound physiologic 'detraining' resulting from motor impairment and immobility. Currently, effective interventions preventing acute declines that lead to cardiovascular compromise and increased risk in SCI are lacking - exercise therapy for those with SCI is challenging and when employed, is typically limited to the upper body. Recently, the investigators refined a unique form of exercise for those with SCI that specifically mirrors exercise performed by those without SCI. Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) Row Training (RT) couples volitional arm and electrically controlled leg exercise, resulting in a hemodynamic profile that produces the beneficial cardiac loading conditions of large muscle mass exercise. As such, FES-RT may be a safe and effective way to attenuate cardiovascular declines following SCI. to test the overall hypotheses that FES-RT will: 1) mitigate against increased visceral adiposity and reduced insulin sensitivity, 2) prevent worsening lipid profile and compromised baroreflex function, and 3) counter ventricular wall thickening and declining ventricular function occurring with acute SCI, and that these effects will be greater than that observed with an arms-only exercise group. Changes with FES-RT will be compared to a time (wait-list) control and to arms-only-RT. Individuals with an SCI within the last 3-6 months will be randomized to FES-RT, to a time control, or arms-only-RT.

Recent developments in neuroimaging have focus on the reasons why some patients recover well while some do poorly. However, there is still no consensus on the exact mechanisms involved in regaining the functions after rehabilitation. Application of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to facilitate neural plasticity during stroke treatment has recently gained considerable attention. m through which rTMS acts is based on the interhemispheric competition (IHC) model, which explains that patients with stroke experience alterations in cortical excitability and exhibit abnormally high interhemispheric inhibition from the unaffected hemisphere to the affected hemisphere. ual feedback training can improve postural control and enhance motor performance. Several rTMS studies have evaluated the lower extremity dysfunction following stroke, but few studies have explored the efficacy of applying rTMS on the lower extremities.

Even 20 years post-injury, re-hospitalization rates remain over 30%.

Typical symptoms comprise pain, numbness or tingling of the thumb and index, middle or ring fingers. Thumb weakness and decreased grip strength can occur in the later stage. Currently treatments included physical modalities (low power laser, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, ultrasound), medication, splinting, injection and surgery. Ultrasound guided intracarpal hydro-dissection of median nerve had been proposed based on its accurate localization, while the injectates were diverse. Corticosteroid has been widely used for CTS for decades. However, growing evidences suggested that 5% dextrose, normal saline, platelet rich plasma injection also have therapeutic effects on alleviating CTS symptoms. Among the injectates, a single 5% dextrose injection could be considered as a substitute of corticosteroid based on its long term effect up to six months.
