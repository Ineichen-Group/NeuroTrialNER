Recent developments in neuroimaging have focus on the reasons why some patients recover well while some do poorly. However, there is still no consensus on the exact mechanisms involved in regaining the functions after rehabilitation. Application of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to facilitate neural plasticity during stroke treatment has recently gained considerable attention. The possible mechanism through which rTMS acts is based on the interhemispheric competition (IHC) model, which explains that patients with stroke experience alterations in cortical excitability and exhibit abnormally high interhemispheric inhibition from the unaffected hemisphere to the affected hemisphere. The visual feedback training can improve postural control and enhance motor performance. Several rTMS studies have evaluated the lower extremity dysfunction following stroke, but few studies have explored the efficacy of applying rTMS on the lower extremities. We expect the study can help us to further exploration of the change of clinical function and cortical excitability following rTMS and visual feedback training in subjects with stroke. In addition, the results of this project will be provided for further rehabilitation programs in people with stroke."

It can be triggered when experiencing virtual reality (VR), and it affects approximately 20% to 80% of individuals who use these resources. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms of CS are not fully understood and the use of virtual environments that have become increasingly recurrent in several sectors deserves attention, as VR is becoming commonplace in methods and techniques of assessment, diagnosis and treatment. Objective: to analyze cortical electrophysiological activity using electroencephalography (EEGq) in individuals with SC, under the influence of different audiovisual conditions. Methodology: The study is a double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial, the sample for survey satisfaction N= 42 participants, the public were university students from the Universidade Federal do Delta Parnaíba (UFDPar) of both sexes, aged between 18 to 28 years, those who agreed, underwent screening, those who met the criteria and fit, were randomized and allocated to one each of 02 conditions, (C1 - video only) and (C2 - associated with binaural audio), three times in each condition, with a duration of 10 minutes of immersion, with evaluation (pre) before (post) with QEEG and Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ), exposure to virtual content was on regular alternate days, with a 24-hour interval between each virtual exposure, at the end of each condition, there will be a 14-day washout and crossover between the conditions, and after the last intervention, there will be a 7-day follow-up and reassessment with qEEG and SSQ. The study will be carried out under all cleaning and prevention care in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic, data collection will be at the Brain Mapping and Functionality Laboratory (LAMCEF) of the Federal University of Delta do Parnaíba, Piauí, Brazil. Results: The condition with binaural stimulation is expected to promote neuromodulation and reduction of CS symptoms, compared to the control condition."

The program focuses on assisting individuals with PD who experience fatigue to establish proper sleep hygiene habits and a physical exercise routine to meet the end goal of reducing fatigue. The aim of the group is to change negative thoughts and behavior regarding changing sleep hygiene habits and exercise behavior into positive ones. This is a feasibility project that aims to explore the feasibility of this protocol as well as to produce a treatment protocol that is able to be replicated by other occupational therapists and health professionals who serve the PD population."

A potential solution to this problem is using new technology like virtual reality during walking training to make stroke survivors have a better sense of their asymmetry. A second problem that we aim to address in this study is whether asymmetry is accurately felt by the stroke survivors and how we can address it. Our ongoing work on the effects of virtual reality on learning new walking tasks in stroke survivors indicates that virtual reality maybe particularly important for those with walking asymmetry. In this study, we plan to recruit stroke survivors who have such asymmetries during walking and have them learn a new walking task in virtual reality. We will also test the stroke survivors to determine if there is a relationship between how well they learn the new task with their ability to feel asymmetry accurately."

The symptoms of HD include involuntary movements, cognitive deterioration and behavioural disturbances. It has been shown that changes in emotion comprehension occur before the onset of the motor symptoms (preHD). This deficit in perception of emotions has been primarily investigated by means of facial expressions. However, emotions can also be expressed through body language. Here, the investigators propose to investigate whether the emotion comprehension deficit in preHD also includes body language comprehension."

In autoimmune neurological diseases, the patient's own immune system 'attacks' the nervous system which might include the brain/spinal cord and/or the peripheral nerves. Giving high-dose chemotherapy, including carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, melphalan, and antithymocyte globulin, before a stem cell transplant weakens the immune system and may help stop the immune system from 'attacking' a patient's nervous system. When the patient's own (autologous) stem cells are infused into the patient they help the bone marrow make red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets so the blood counts can improve."

Onset during adolescence can be disruptive to schoolwork and social relationships and if left untreated can lead to recurrence during adulthood, as well as the development of other mental health problems. Current treatments for depression (for both adults and young people) largely focus on reducing low mood and do not effectively tackle the other hallmark symptom of depression, anhedonia, which is characterised as a loss of enjoyment/ pleasure for previously enjoyed activities. Anhedonia is associated with increased risk of suicidality, so should be an important treatment target. Whilst some adult treatments are beginning to address anhedonia, little research has focussed on young people. It cannot be assumed that adult treatments will work identically in young people, particularly s their brains are still maturing compared to adults. The aim of this study is to complete a randomised feasibility trial, to see if it is possible to run a brief talking therapy for anhedonia in adolescent depression, by targeting one promising cognitive factor known to contribute to low positive affect: positive future mental imagery"

the effects of aerobic training compared to conventional motor training on motor and cardio-vascular parameters;
the effect of aerobic training compared to conventional motor training on cognitive performance, depression and fatigue;
the modifications of functional activations during a cognitive task and of functional connectivity in motor and cognitive networks during resting state following aerobic training and conventional motor training (functional plasticity);

Studies have nevertheless shown that walking exercise therapy can improve walking capacity in pwMS. This may be particularly potent if occurring outdoors due to the varying stimuli it can provide (different surfaces and terrain etc.), and if the intensity and duration is adequate. Furthermore, outdoor walking is (1) suitable as a group intervention facilitating interaction between pwMS and (2) advantageous due to the health benefits offered through the interaction with nature itself. Both these aspects are also relevant for well-being.

Few studies have nevertheless examined the effects of outdoor walking exercise therapy in pwMS. The purpose of the present study is therefore to examine the effects of 7 weeks of moderate-to-high intensity outdoor walking exercise therapy on walking capacity (primary outcome: 6-minute walk test) and well-being in pwMS."

SDB confers the risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and is associated with adverse maternal and foetal outcomes.

The study would involve pregnant females which would be prospectively followed in pregnancy and post partum to know the prevalence of sleep disorders in pregnancy.

Chinese are more prone to developing SVD than Caucasians. Physical exercise may improve multiple negative consequences associated with SVD.

Objective and hypothesis to be tested: To examine the effects of a 24-week structured aerobic dance training on cognition, mood, physical and daily functions in stroke and dementia free older adults with SVD, and whether such effects are mediated through improved cerebral vasomotor reactivity (CVR), a marker of cerebral autoregulation which is impaired in SVD.

Design and subjects: Rater-blind RCT comparing the effects of 24-week of structured aerobic dance training upon cognition, mood, physical and daily functions on 110 community dwelling, stroke- and dementia-free persons aged ≥65 with MRI evidence of significant SVD, defined as the presence of multiple (≥2) lacunes and/or early confluent or confluent WML.

Interventions: Participants are randomized in a 1:1 ratio into a 24-week of structured therapist-led group aerobic dance training with home practice or simple stretching plus health education control group.

Main outcome measures: Cognition, mood, physical and daily functions and CVR measured using Transcranial Doppler at baseline, weeks 12, 24 and 36.

Data analysis: Intent-to-treat with multiple imputations with treatment efficacy analyzed using mixed effects models. Mediation effects of CVR between aerobic dance training and treatment outcomes tested using mediation models.

Expected results: In persons with significant SVD, aerobic dance training improves cognitive, mood, physical and daily functions and such effects are mediated by changes in CVR."

One of the complications with the greatest impact in people with SCI is Neuropathic Pain (NP). Pain, mainly chronic pain, has an effect on emotional states, cognition regarding pain and anticipation which leads to the catastrophization of the pain. This form of pain is related to chronic diseases that develop with pain of poor prognosis and are detrimental to quality of life therefore having enormous impacts on health systems. The physiological mechanisms of Hydrotherapy on pain are clear and there is evidence of its use in the management of painful syndromes of difficult treatments such as that for fibromyalgia and chronic lumbar pain, as well as its positive effect on pain perception. However, the effects of hydrotherapy on the NP of patients with SCI are unknown.

Randomized, controlled clinical trial of parallel groups. A randomized sequence will be carried out in balanced blocks to assign the intervention (Hydrotherapy) or the control (Standard Physical Therapy), to a sample of 28 participants, 14 for each group. Each of the interventions (hydrotherapy and physical therapy) will last 9 weeks, for a total of 18 sessions (2 weekly sessions). Two measurements will be made, baseline (pre-intervention) and a second time one month after the end of the intervention. The validated Spanish scales will be used: NP-4 (NP Screening), Numerical Pain Scale (END), PCS (Pain Catastrophization), SF-36 (Health-related quality of life) and WHODAS 2.0 (Disability). The primary outcome is the level of NP and its catastrophization, and the secondary outcomes are level of disability and quality of life. With 28 participants fully measured, it is possible to have 80% power to find differences between the groups with respect to the primary outcomes. All information will be analyzed using average comparisons with 95% confidence. The analysis will be carried out by Intention to Treat (ITT) taking all the randomized participants. Missing data will be processed through multiple imputation chains. Generalized mixed linear models will be used comparing the standardized baseline and post-intervention averages of each group and between each group, obtaining 95% confidence intervals and p-values. Subgroup analysis will be performed adjusting confounders and interactions. A significant difference will be considered when the value of p is less than 0.05. Cohen´s D will be calculated to identify the size of the intervention effect.

Discussion: The results will reflect the effect of the hydrotherapy on NP in patients with SCI. They will also permit the identification of potential changes in functionality levels or quality of life in the intervened population."

The investigators will test conditions in the blood and spinal fluid to determine the best time to start this new training program. This will include checking for certain features called biomarkers by testing participants' spinal fluid and blood and compare these features to individuals without SCI. These features will help investigators determine when to start the new training program, either right away or waiting for 3 months. The new training program uses walking downhill on a slight slope on a treadmill while muscles that are not working normally are stimulated to contract using low levels of electricity. Adding this stimulation will allow people to practice walking and other skills even though full muscle control has not recovered. This new program will be in addition to any other rehabilitation therapy and will not replace standard rehabilitation. The hope is to see if downhill training with muscle stimulation, when delivered at the most ideal time, will improve trunk and leg movement, walking, and overall function. This recovery of movement and function will be compared to people with SCI receiving standard rehabilitation alone. Certain regions of the brain and spinal cord will also be studied using MRI scans to determine if these are affected by the training and compare to individuals without SCI. The total length of the study for SCI participants will be up to 16 weeks if in the standard of care group and up to 33 weeks if in the trained group. Healthy control participants will be involved for 1-2 visits."

The study was designed as a randomized controlled trial. At the beginning of the study, demographic data and characteristics of the cases will be recorded. Patients will be evaluated in three different periods throughout the study. The first assessments will be performed on the first day after the patient's condition is appropriate after the surgical procedure for Type 1 CM. Following this evaluation, all patients will be divided into two groups using. a simple randomization method. The first group will be exercised for 6 weeks while the second group will not be intervened during this period and will be followed as a control group. Immediately after the exercise program administered to the first group after 6 weeks, both groups will undergo second assessments. After these assessment measures, the same exercise program in the first group will be applied to the second group only this time for 6 weeks. In the meantime, the first group will stop their exercise programs. After the 6-week exercise program of the second group has ended, both groups will be given the third assessment, the final assessment.

At the beginning of the study, demographic data, characteristics and disease information will be recorded.

The evaluations to be made are summarized below:

Visual Analogue Scale, pain threshold and pain tolerance tests, Neck Disability Index, for the determination of pain level in the neck region and throughout the body
Cervical range of motion (Performance Attainment Associates, St. Paul, MN, 55117, United States) (CROM 3) device for the evaluation of the cervical region.

Rapid response to treatment -cessation of binge eating and vomiting symptoms within the first weeks of treatment - is a robust predictor of improved post-treatment outcomes and lower relapse rates, but no study has tried to facilitate rapid response as a means of improving treatment outcomes. The present study responds to this gap in the literature by testing a 4-session CBT-based individual intervention for rapid response (i.e., ""CBT-RR""), designed to augment standard day hospital (DH) treatment for BN and Purging Disorder (PD) by focusing on strategies and skills for rapid symptom interruption. CBT-RR will be compared to a matched-intensity augmentative motivational interviewing (MI) intervention. Participants will be recruited from a hospital-based day program for eating disorders, and will be randomly assigned to one of the two conditions in addition to the DH as usual. participants will be assessed at pre-intervention, post-intervention, week 4 of DH, post-DH, and 6 months follow-up. It is hypothesized that compared to those who receive MI, patients who receive CBT-RR will be more likely to exhibit a rapid response to day hospital treatment (i.e., </= 3 binge eating and/or vomiting episodes in the first 4 weeks). It is further hypothesized that patients who receive CBT-RR will exhibit fewer binge eating and/or vomiting episodes at post-DH and at 6-month follow-up. Potential mediators and moderators of these hypothesized treatment effects will be examined on an exploratory basis, including self-efficacy, motivation, and hope (potential mediators), and emotion regulation, depression, cognitive psychopathology of eating disorders, and working alliance with the therapist (potential moderators)."

Pathophysiologically, increased pharyngeal collapsibility is a major endotype of the disease and the investigators have shown that this surgery can improve pharyngeal compliance. The development of approaches to treat pharyngeal hypotonia by maxillofacial rehabilitation supports the treatment of this endotype. A study in adults showed a benefit from playing the didgeridoo, a wind instrument, for 3 months, without pathophysiological explanation. The investigators hypothesise that playing this instrument improves pharyngeal compliance (re-education effect) in a similar way to the effect observed after otorhinolaryngology surgery.

This proof-of-concept study aims to demonstrate the effect of didgeridoo in children without syndromic pathology with a formal otorhinolaryngology surgical indication resulting from tonsillar hypertrophy (Brodsky grades III and IV) and symptomatology suggestive of Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Syndrome (Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire score ≥ 0.33). The investigators will take advantage of the long delay in performing the adenoidectomy (~6 months) in their university hospital to evaluate, before the scheduled surgery, the effect of the didgeridoo used for three months."

The therapy is intended to reverse the loss of motor and sensory function.

Following non-CNS tissue injury, macrophages quickly arrive on the scene, where they clean up cell debris, secrete different molecules thus promoting a controlled inflammatory reaction that forms the first phase of the wound healing process. While this process occurs in most tissues, including peripheral nerves, it does not occur in the CNS, where macrophages and other immune cells are relatively rare, and their activities curtailed by a biochemical mechanism known as ""immune privilege.""

In animal studies, it appears that incubated macrophages circumvent the immune privilege, thus supporting the regrowth of axons through the injury site and enabling the recovery of neurological function. The concept derives from the pioneering research of Prof. Michal Schwartz at the Weizmann Institute of Science."

CFS, CF and FM are incapacitating disorders characterized by profound fatigue, muscle pain, impaired memory, insomnia, and post-exertional malaise (Fukuda 1994). Current literature points to a centrally sensitized state in CFS, CF and FM (Meeus 2007). The ARP attempts to retrain this neuronal network through mind-body practices such as cognitive restructuring via neurolinguistic programming, yoga based breathing and simple mindfulness based meditation. A case series of 33 patients with CFS and ARP reported improvement in 92% of patients with two-thirds of patients reaching 80-100% of pre-illness levels of health (Gupta 2009). However ARP has never been formally studied in CFS.

We propose to gather preliminary data on the efficacy and feasibility of ARP versus C on fatigue, quality of life and sleep in 30 patients with CFS, CF and FM. All participants will undergo standard clinical treatment which consist of a 2 day self-management program in the Chronic Fatigue Clinic. Following this, participants will be randomized into the ARP or C group. The ARP group will receive an additional 2.5 hour training surrounding core concepts of the ARP program. They will then be given the ARP DVD program and booklet, to reinforce and continue the practice. They will then receive scheduled bi-monthly phone calls for 3 months from a study investigator for support. The C group will receive only standard care. However they will receive a complementary copy of the ARP program at the end of the study (6 month time point) as a gift for participation in the study.

Preliminary data on efficacy will be assessed at baseline, 1, 3 and 6 months using the following validated questionnaires: Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MDFI), Short form-36 (SF36) Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), Epworth Sleep Scale (ESS) and Measure Your Medical Outcome Profile (MYMOP-2). Feasibility will be assessed by evaluation of a daily practice log where patients record the total time spent daily in the practice of ARP and any specific difficulties they encountered in the practice of the program."

Within the first year of injury, more than 50% of people discharged with a SCI may require re-hospitalization due to a secondary complication, such as a urinary tract infection, pressure ulcer or pneumonia. Even 20 years post-injury, re-hospitalization rates remain over 30%. While re-hospitalization rates in Canada have remained high for more than 10 years, the length of stay in inpatient rehabilitation has decreased dramatically, thereby limiting the time for provision of health information and skill acquisition in the inpatient rehabilitation setting. There is growing evidence from two recent pilot trials to suggest that self-management programs that provide appropriate health information, skills and telephone-based support for community-dwelling patients with SCI improves health behaviors and leads to reductions in re-hospitalization.

Goals/Research Aim: To conduct a pilot RCT (feasibility study) that will inform the design of a definitive RCT to determine whether an online self-management program incorporating trained peer health coaches (called ""SCI&U"") compared to usual care will result in improved self-management skills (short-term outcome) and lead to reduced days of hospitalization (long-term outcome) due to secondary complications.This pilot study is a two-group RCT with an embedded qualitative component. The target population is adults with SCI who have been discharged from inpatient rehabilitation and living in the community. Sixty subjects will be recruited from across Canada with a focus on British Columbia and Ontario and randomly assigned to the SCI&U intervention or usual care.

Evaluations will occur at baseline, 2, 6, and 12 months."

It is well-understood that many factors, such as poor education, lower income, or occupational, and recreational activity associated with high noise exposure, influences the prevalence and risk of tinnitus. Although the economic and emotional impact of tinnitus is large, there is currently no FDA-approved medication to treat this condition. However, there are pharmacological options to address the stress, anxiety, and depression that are caused by tinnitus. In this project, we intend to use medications for patients with tinnitus in order to decrease the impact of tinnitus on their daily life and activities."

Physical activity is important for persons with disabilities to maintain physical function. A lack of physical activity can contribute to heart disease, osteoporosis, obesity, and diabetes. At the moment, the best way for people with MS to exercise and be physical activity is unknown. People with MS report not knowing what to do. This is a barrier to exercise.

The global aim of this study is to contribute evidence for the role of targeted exercise in altering MS outcomes over time. The design is a randomized controlled trial (RCT). The primary research question is to what extent does an MS Tailored Exercise Program (MSTEP) result in greater improvements in exercise capacity and related outcomes in comparison to a program based on general guidelines for exercise among people with MS who are sedentary and wish to engage in exercise as part of MS self-management. The primary outcome for this question is exercise capacity measured using cycle ergometry. However exercise efficiency, functional ambulation, strength, components of quality of life including frequency and intensity of fatigue symptoms, mood, global physical function, health perception, and illness intrusiveness, will also be measured as components of a global response outcome. The first confirmatory hypothesis is that MSTEP will result in a greater proportion of people making clinically relevant gains (at least 10% change) in exercise capacity than with general guidelines after 12 months of intervention; a secondary hypothesis is that, while there may be some decline in exercise capacity among individuals from end of intervention to follow-up one year later, the decline will be greater in the general guideline group augmenting the difference between groups in the proportion making 10% change from study entry to 24 months. In other words, gains will be maintained more for the MSTEP group over the general guideline group.

An exploratory hypothesis is that more of the targeted outcomes will improve with the MSTEP program than the general guideline approach. An explanatory hypothesis is that these gains will be accompanied by reports of greater exercise enjoyment and exercise self-efficacy (confidence) with the MSTEP program than with the general guideline program leading to more consistent exercise engagement and improved long-term adherence."

Typical symptoms comprise pain, numbness or tingling of the thumb and index, middle or ring fingers. Thumb weakness and decreased grip strength can occur in the later stage. Currently treatments included physical modalities (low power laser, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, ultrasound), medication, splinting, injection and surgery. Ultrasound guided intracarpal hydro-dissection of median nerve had been proposed based on its accurate localization, while the injectates were diverse. Corticosteroid has been widely used for CTS for decades. However, growing evidences suggested that 5% dextrose, normal saline, platelet rich plasma injection also have therapeutic effects on alleviating CTS symptoms. Among the injectates, a single 5% dextrose injection could be considered as a substitute of corticosteroid based on its long term effect up to six months. However, the clinical efficacy of 5% dextrose injection has not validated by the further study. The investigators aim to compare the therapeutic effect of 5% dextrose injection with corticosteroid injection in patients with CTS, up to 12 weeks follow up."

While there is evidence that demonstrates positive effects of speech-language treatment for individuals with PPA who only speak one language (monolinguals), there is a significant need for investigating the effects of treatment that is optimized for bilingual speakers with PPA. This stage 2 efficacy clinical trial seeks to establish the effects of culturally and linguistically tailored speech-language interventions administered to bilingual individuals with PPA.

The overall aim of the intervention component of this study is to establish the relationships between the bilingual experience (e.g., how often each language is used, how ""strong"" each language is) and treatment response of bilinguals with PPA. Specifically, the investigators will evaluate the benefits of tailored speech-language intervention administered in both languages to bilingual individuals with PPA (60 individuals will be recruited). The investigators will conduct an assessment before treatment, after treatment and at two follow-ups (6 and 12-months post-treatment) in both languages. When possible, a structural scan of the brain (magnetic resonance image) will be collected before treatment in order to identify if brain regions implicated in bilingualism are associated with response to treatment. In addition to the intervention described herein, 30 bilingual individuals with PPA will be recruited to complete behavioral cognitive-linguistic testing and will not receive intervention. Results will provide important knowledge about the neural mechanisms of language re-learning and will address how specific characteristics of bilingualism influence cognitive reserve and linguistic resilience in PPA."

The goal of treatment is to improve functional status and symptoms, but the optimal treatment regimen for these patients has not been thoroughly established. Many patients with SCC present with uncontrolled systemic disease and poor performance status, and are not eligible for standard surgical resection. They are generally treated with 3D conformal palliative RT (3DCRT) alone, however recent trials suggest that less than 70% of patients are ambulatory, that the re-establishment of ambulation in non-ambulatory patients is poor, and the duration of improvement is guarded with radiotherapy alone.

Recently, stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) used alone or after previous radiotherapy to treat spinal metastasis has demonstrated superior results in pain control, tumour response and durability. SBRT requires time for careful planning, and many patients with neurologic symptoms must be treated immediately to prevent progression. Therefore the role of SBRT is still unclear in this patient population, although it seems to be a potential alternative to surgical decompression in patient not suitable for surgery. The investigators propose a feasibility study to investigate the potential benefits of dose escalation with a sequential SBRT boost to urgent 3D CRT in the setting of SCC. This regimen will allow inoperable patients to receive urgent 3DCRT while simultaneously creating the opportunity for superior outcomes with SBRT. The investigators also aim to characterize the effect on motor function and ambulation, pain and QoL. This study could stimulate further multi-center randomized trials in this area, improve motor function and patient-reported QoL, and contribute to improving oncology care in Canada in a meaningful way."

CAR T cells are delivered via an indwelling catheter into the tumor resection cavity or ventricular system in children and young adults with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), diffuse midline glioma (DMG), and recurrent or refractory CNS tumors.

A child or young adult meeting all eligibility criteria, including having a CNS catheter placed into the tumor resection cavity or into their ventricular system, and meeting none of the exclusion criteria, will have their T cells collected. The T cells will then be bioengineered into a second-generation CAR T cell that targets B7H3-expressing tumor cells. Patients will be assigned to one of 3 treatment arms based on location or type of their tumor. Patients with supratentorial tumors will be assigned to Arm A, and will receive their treatment into the tumor cavity. Patients with either infratentorial or metastatic/leptomeningeal tumors will be assigned to Arm B, and will have their treatment delivered into the ventricular system. The first 3 patients enrolled onto the study must be at least 15 years of age and assigned to Arm A or Arm B. Patients with DIPG will be assigned to Arm C and have their treatment delivered into the ventricular system. The patient's newly engineered T cells will be administered via the indwelling catheter for two courses. In the first course patients in Arms A and B will receive a weekly dose of CAR T cells for three weeks, followed by a week off, an examination period, and then another course of weekly doses for three weeks. Patients in Arm C will receive a dose of CAR T cells every other week for 3 weeks, followed by a week off, an examination period, and then dosing every other week for 3 weeks. Following the two courses, patients in all Arms will undergo a series of studies including MRI to evaluate the effect of the CAR T cells and may have the opportunity to continue receiving additional courses of CAR T cells if the patient has not had adverse effects and if more of their T cells are available.

The hypothesis is that an adequate amount of B7H3-specific CAR T cells can be manufactured to complete two courses of treatment with 3 or 2 doses given on a weekly schedule followed by one week off in each course. The other hypothesis is that B7H3-specific CAR T cells can safely be administered through an indwelling CNS catheter or delivered directly into the brain via indwelling catheter to allow the T cells to directly interact with the tumor cells for each patient enrolled on the study. Secondary aims of the study will include evaluating CAR T cell distribution with the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the extent to which CAR T cells egress or traffic into the peripheral circulation or blood stream, and, if tissues samples from multiple timepoints are available, also evaluate disease response to B7-H3 CAR T cell locoregional therapy."

It will be a question of better understanding the neuro-functional mechanisms which underlie the lack of self-compassion and the disorder of empathy in schizophrenia, the relationship that these disorders maintain between them but also the relationship that they maintain with the general psychopathology of schizophrenia and, in particular, with the abnormalities of the self. In other words, the overall framework of this project is that of the link between the psychopathology of schizophrenia and the functional impairment associated with it. Its specific field of application is that of the link between self-awareness disorders, self-compassion deficit and empathy disorder. For this, this project proposes a methodological approach combining the recording of intrinsic and extrinsic brain activity using high-density electroencephalography (EEG)."

The relatively low incidence of permanent adverse effects and the potential for neuroprotection and alteration of the natural course of PD suggest a highly favorable benefit-to-risk ratio of this procedure. Since neuroprotection is best applied early in the disease course when there are more surviving neurons, we believe that further investigation of this procedure is warranted. The proposed pilot study will provide the necessary data to substantiate the safety and tolerability of the procedure as well as provide data for the design of a full-scale, multicenter trial to investigate the hypothesis that B-STN DBS is a safe and effective treatment to slow the progression of PD."

However, approximately one third of them will lose it in next 6 months after cochlear implantation. Although the mechanisms involved in the residual audition loss remain unknown, animal experiments suggest the role of inflammatory or immune reaction in the cochlea. The goal of this project is to search in the perilymph (a fluid which fills the scala vestibuli and scala tympani of the cochlea) some predictive biomarkers of the residual hearing loss using modern proteomics and immunological techniques. A parallel search for blood biomarkers of post-implantation residual hearing loss and for molecular and cellular evidences of immune response to cochlear implantation will be performed.

The study will recruit 50 subjects-candidates for cochlear implantation surgery; 30 normally hearing individuals eligible for other types of otological interventions will form a control group. For all the participants blood samples will be collected and preserved. In addition, the perilymph sampling will be performed during cochlear implantation surgery.

This project relies on the calculation that from 50 patients post-cochlear implantation, 15 patients will form a group with maintained residual hearing and 15 will display delayed hearing loss. For these 30 subjects together with the control group the blood biomarkers search will be performed.

For the group of implanted patients, the follow-up will last for 12 months with 6 visits in total :

the inclusion visit V0 during which the study will be presented and the consent form will be signed
the surgery visit V1 with blood sample and perilymph collection
the activation visit V2, 1 month ± 1 week after V1, visit V3 3 months ± 7 days after V1, V4 6 months ± 7 days after V1, V5 12 months ± 1 month after V1. During each of this visit blood sampling will be performed.

For the control group, the follow up will be 6 months long with 4 visits in total arranged during the routine follow-up appointments:

the inclusion visit V0 during which the study will be presented and the consent form will be signed
the surgery visit V1, the 1 month visit V2 and the 6 months visit V3 during which the blood sampling will be performed."

The purpose of this study is to better characterize the retina and optic nerve in newborns using spectral domain optical coherence tomography (s-oct). This new technology provides a very detailed cross-section picture of the cellular layers in the retina and a 3-dimensional picture of the optic nerve head and the fovea (the center of the retina that provides the most accurate vision). These images have been used by doctors for more than 5 years to help diagnose and treat adults with eye diseases, such as macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, retinal detachments, and melanoma. But, it has never been studied in newborns. In newborns, it would potentially help in the diagnoses of glaucoma, optic nerve hypoplasia, foveal hypoplasia, and colobomata among many other disorders. Prior to diagnosing disorders, it is necessary to establish normal values. It is the purpose of this investigation to study the retina and optic nerves in neonates to establish normal values.

After a parent of a normal newborn provides a written consent, the baby will be taken to the Eye Clinic where the instrument is located. The baby will be swaddled in one or more blankets as needed. The infants will be held in front of the instrument by a nurse. The technician will move the lens of the instrument to about 2 to 4 inches from the baby's eye. The mild light from the instrument will then enter the eye for a few seconds to obtain the desired image. The image can be captured through an immobile eye within 5 seconds. If the baby is fussy, he or she may be given a few drops of a sugar (sucrose) solution on a pacifier for calming. Although the images can usually be secured through a normal pupil, if the pupil is found to be too small, two drops of Cyclomydril will be placed on the eye for dilation. This is the eye drop used everyday in the Eye Clinic and nursery to dilate the pupils of babies. The dilation will last for about 6 to 10 hours. After the test, the baby will return to the nursery or be discharged home as intended by the Neonatology Division.

There is minimal risk associated with this investigation. The instrument is non-invasive and does not touch the eye. The babies will be swaddled and held by a nurse to prevent any contact with the machine. The eye drop to be used if needed for dilation has been used on babies at Harbor for about 30 years. It has been found to very safe. The fact that we will study only term (not premature babies) and will apply only two drops if needed should minimize any risk from the eye drop.

An ethical issue to consider is that while the study will provide important information that will undoubtedly help babies in the future, it will probably not benefit the baby being studied. However, if the baby has an undetected retinal or optic nerve problem, the study may reveal it."

The improvement of parkinsonian motor symptoms by stimulation of the STN is 50 to 80% on average. The main advantage of DBS is that the surgery has low morbidity and mortality, it is adaptable to the patient's symptoms and its effect is reversible. This treatment is now a routine and more than 85,000 patients worldwide have benefited from the installation of this system. Since 1997, this treatment is available to patients followed in the Pitié Salpêtrière (GHPS).

The accuracy of preoperative anatomic targeting in stereotactic neurosurgery will improve with the use of high-field MRI. However, several new issues and inherent in that high-field MRI should be evaluated before the images can be used directly.

The chosen sequences must be short to be feasible, minimizing patient discomfort, and evaluated on several patients to ensure the low interindividual variability. In addition, the quality of the display on all of the sections should provide a reliable three-dimensional information. Finally, the quality of targeting and its possible improvement should be checked."

In about 60% of cases, motor disabilities are associated with cognitive deficits. The present study aims to compare three forms of cognitive / motor rehabilitation in three groups of patients with MS: rehabilitation of verbal memory with the Rehacom program; combined rehabilitation, associating a motor rehabilitation path with the Rehacom program; only motor rehabilitation course. Aims of the study will be: to verify whether the combined cognitive / motor rehabilitation can induce a significantly greater improvement in the memory performance of patients with MS compared to rehabilitation alone; check whether any improvement is objectively verifiable by patients and the impact it may have on patients' quality of life; monitor these effects after 6 months.

For these purposes, three homogeneous groups of 20 patients each will be enrolled, diagnosed with MS according to Mc Donald's criteria revisited by Polman (2011). The study will be divided into an initial clinical, cognitive, emotional, quality of life and functional self-perception (T0) assessment. Subsequently, the patients assigned to the three conditions will be provided with the pre-established rehabilitation treatments for a total duration of 12 weeks; at the end, each patient will undergo an overall re-evaluation (T1). Finally, a further overall reassessment will be carried out after 6 months, aimed at follow-up monitoring (T2).

Statistical analyzes will be of two types:

Within Group (aimed at assessing any improvement in the cognitive performance of each group of patients by comparing the assessments at T0 with those at T1 and T2); Between Group (aimed at comparing the results obtained by each group with those of the other 2 groups at T0, T1, and T2)."

In fact, acquired cardiovascular disease is an increasingly recognized consequence of SCI and is the leading cause of death in SCI. Though incompletely understood, the almost 10-fold prevalence of cardiovascular disease results in part from profound physiologic 'detraining' resulting from motor impairment and immobility. Currently, effective interventions preventing acute declines that lead to cardiovascular compromise and increased risk in SCI are lacking - exercise therapy for those with SCI is challenging and when employed, is typically limited to the upper body. Recently, the investigators refined a unique form of exercise for those with SCI that specifically mirrors exercise performed by those without SCI. Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) Row Training (RT) couples volitional arm and electrically controlled leg exercise, resulting in a hemodynamic profile that produces the beneficial cardiac loading conditions of large muscle mass exercise. As such, FES-RT may be a safe and effective way to attenuate cardiovascular declines following SCI. The investigators aims are to test the overall hypotheses that FES-RT will: 1) mitigate against increased visceral adiposity and reduced insulin sensitivity, 2) prevent worsening lipid profile and compromised baroreflex function, and 3) counter ventricular wall thickening and declining ventricular function occurring with acute SCI, and that these effects will be greater than that observed with an arms-only exercise group. Changes with FES-RT will be compared to a time (wait-list) control and to arms-only-RT. Individuals with an SCI within the last 3-6 months will be randomized to FES-RT, to a time control, or arms-only-RT. Measures will be made at baseline and 6 months. The investigators work will provide results that clearly delineate potential health benefits of FES-RT, and if FES-RT is effective in a majority of those with SCI, its application, implementation, and integration could be easily replicated."

A wide array of studies confirms that intravenous thrombolytic therapy with alteplase can effectively improve the functional prognosis in acute ischemic stroke. Thus all guidelines recommended the intravenous thrombolytic therapy with alteplase for acute ischemic stroke within 4.5 hours from stroke onset.

Minor stroke is usually defined as NIHSS score ≤ 3 or 5，although it accounts for 1/2-2/3 of AIS, the evidence of thrombolysis is insufficient. A study from Canada shows that 28.5% of patients with minor stroke who have not receive rt-pa thrombolytic therapy are unable to walk independently when discharged. Based on such a consideration,the PRISMS study further compares the efficacy and safety of thrombolytic therapy with antithrombotic therapy in patients with minor stroke. Unfortunately, the study has been early terminated due to the sponsorship reason in 2018, with only 313 cases enrolled. The preliminary results shows that there is no significant difference of the 90-day neurological function between the two groups, while the safety of the treatment group with alteplase has a higher rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. The patient receiving thrombolysis can not be given antithrombolytic therapy within 24 hours even if the patient's condition has worsened, is clinically more puzzling.

The CHANCE study in 2013 shows that the efficacy of aspirin with clopidogrel is superior to aspirin alone with minor stroke (NIHSS < 3) or TIA(ABCD2 < 4). The POINT study in 2018 further confirmed the efficacy and safety of intensive antithrombotic therapy within 12 hours of onset with minor stroke.

Based on the above discussion, this study aims to explore the efficacy and safety of aspirin with clopidogrel vs alteplase in the treatment of acute minor stroke."
