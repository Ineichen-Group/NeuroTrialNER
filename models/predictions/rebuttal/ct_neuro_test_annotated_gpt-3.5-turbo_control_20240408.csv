1,NCT04576507,"Effects of Repeated Cannabis Administration on Experimental Pain and Abuse Liability in Humans | Chronic pain is a significant public health concern in the U.S., for which prescription opioids have historically been the standard treatment. This has resulted in striking rates of opioid use disorders and fatal overdoses. Identifying non-opioid medications for the management of chronic pain with minimal abuse liability is a public health necessity, and cannabinoids are a promising drug class for this purpose. More than 80% of medicinal cannabis users report pain as their primary medical indication. These patients tend to seek products that are low in delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC; the primary psychoactive, and thus intoxicating, component of cannabis), and high in cannabidiol (CBD), a cannabinoid that purportedly has therapeutic benefit for pain but does not produce intoxicating effects [1]. However, there are few well-controlled human laboratory studies assessing the efficacy of high-CBD cannabis for pain in the context of abuse, and even less is known regarding the effects of daily repeated use of cannabis on pain and its relationship to abuse liability.

The proposed randomized, within-subjects, placebo-controlled 16-day crossover inpatient human laboratory pilot study (N = 16 healthy cannabis users; 8 men, 8 women) will address important gaps in our understanding of the potential therapeutic utility of cannabis for pain: 1) If repeated cannabis use can result in hyperalgesia; 2) If tolerance to the analgesic and abuse-related effects of cannabis develops and is reversible. Two distinct modalities of experimental pain will be assessed: The Cold Pressor Test (CPT) and Quantitative Sensory Testing Thermal Temporal Summation (QST-TTS), and participants will smoke cannabis 3x/day. Throughout the study, experimental pain and abuse-related effects will be assessed, as will sleep and subjective mood assessments.","The comparator interventions in the provided clinical trial text are not explicitly mentioned.

16,NCT04610879,"Randomised Factorial Design Controlled Trial Comparing Carbamazepine, Levetiracetam or Active Monitoring Combined With or Without Sleep Behaviour Intervention in Treatment Naive Children With Rolandic Epilepsy | Rolandic epilepsy (RE) is the most common type of epilepsy. Children with RE have seizures and can often find that their learning, sleep, behaviour, self-esteem and mood are affected.

As part of standard NHS care, children diagnosed with RE may be treated with standard anti-epileptic medicines, like carbamazepine, or no medicine at all. The medicines used to treat epilepsy often slow down a child's thinking and learning. In the past, doctors believed this was an acceptable price to pay to reduce seizures. However, with RE, where the seizures usually stop in teenage years, investigators do not know if it is better to treat these children with medicines or not, especially if the medicines might have a negative effect on their learning.

A newer medicine called levetiracetam has also been found to work in children with RE and has shown less problems with thinking and learning in adults. However, it is still no known if this is also the case for children and it has not been proven which of the three options (carbamazepine, levetiracetam or no treatment) would be best for RE patients. The CASTLE study aims to find this out.

In addition, it has been found that seizures often happen when a child has had poor sleep and they often come at night or early in the morning. It has been shown that sleep can be improved through practice without the need of medicines. There are established guidelines to help toddlers go to sleep, but nothing available that helps young people with epilepsy and their parents improve their sleep quality. In the CASTLE study, a sleep training plan has been developed for children with epilepsy and the trial aims to find out whether following this sleep training plan results in less seizures than using no sleep training at all.","The comparator interventions extracted from the clinical trial are:

18,NCT01751347,"Bupivacaine Versus Lidocaine Local Anesthesia in Elective Outpatient Hand Surgery: A Randomized Controlled Trial | The use of local anesthetics has become an important aspect of pain management in surgical settings and is currently recommended in pain management guidelines.

Elective outpatient hand surgeries, such as carpal tunnel or trigger finger release, cause minimum tissue disruption and are short in duration. As a result, these local anesthetic agents are a major component in post-operative pain control. The most commonly used local anesthetic agents are Lidocaine and Bupivacaine. Lidocaine acts faster (within 2-5 minutes of injection) and for this reason is often favored in outpatient setting for pre-incisional injection. However its effects only last up to 2 hours, without epinephrine, and 3 hours, with epinephrine. On the other hand, Bupivacaine, has a slower onset of action (about 5-10 minutes after injection) but its effects last much longer, for about 4-8 hours. The delay in onset of action makes it a less popular option as a primary source of local anesthesia in outpatient hand surgery.

Given the longer duration of anesthesia offered by Bupivacaine, the investigators believe that by giving it pre-operatively in elective outpatient hand surgeries will offer more effective post operative pain control compared to using Lidocaine only. There is limited published data confirming the effectiveness of use of pre-operative Bupivicaine in improved postoperative pain control and decreased consumption of narcotics. Therefore, the aim in this study is to compare the postoperative pain experienced by patients undergoing either elective carpal tunnel release or trigger finger release as well as their use of pain medications when the incision site is infiltrated preemptively with Lidocaine versus Bupivacaine.

The investigators believe that adequate post surgical pain control is essential for patients' full functional recovery. Poorly controlled post surgical pain increases incidence of surgery related complications and thus increased health care costs. It can also reduce patients' mobility, delay their return to full function,. If poorly controlled, post surgical pain may progress to chronic pain and rarely complex regional pain syndromes may ensue.","The comparator interventions extracted from the clinical trial are:

24,NCT05473676,"Robotic Walking for Children Who Cannot Walk | A common problem among children with nervous system disorders is difficulty walking on their own. This has impacts beyond mobility including short and long-term health conditions associated with physical inactivity and different developmental experiences as a result of the mobility impairments. A robotic trainer can both provide rehabilitation and be an assistive device to help compensate for difficulties. Figuring out how to prescribe it is critical to improve daily life for children with significant disabilities. Preliminary use of robotic trainers have shown many benefits, such as better head control and improved independence in transfers, which greatly increases ability to live independently. Additionally, vital functions that are frequently impaired in those with less physical activity, such as sleep and bowel habits, seem to improve. Finally, these children enjoy using them.

This project aims to determine who is most likely to benefit from training with a robotic trainer and investigate key details about the dose of training that is needed. Families that are already using or hope to use robotic training need this data to help improve their access to the intervention. Clinicians need this systematic approach to building evidence to ensure a future multi-centre randomized control trial is well designed. This study is needed to help improve the lives of those who live with significant disabilities. The objective is to evaluate the feasibility and impacts of delivering robotic gait training at home. Integral in this study is capturing the user perspectives. This will both provide preliminary evidence-based advice to potential users, their families, and clinicians as well as provide key metrics to design a definitive multi-centre randomized control trial.

A chorological relation between EEG signals and ECG signals is our first target to be worked out. Thereafter, we hope to establish a regression model of all involved parameters according to the relation. Such a model, we believe, is essential not only to explain the post-CABG neurological complications, but to prevent them.

Furthermore, for the undetermined ischemic stroke patients who had no obvious culprit artery or embolism source, the paroxysmal arrhythmia had long been regarded as the cause. Whether a paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which had not been disclosed by routine ECG, could induce most of such a stroke is still not known. With this new ambulatory device which could record the electrocardiograph (ECG) and electroencephalograph (EEG) simultaneously, we want to answer the question.","The comparator interventions in the provided clinical trial are:

41,NCT02899858,"Restoration of Standing and Walking With ISMS in Humans | Spinal cord neural circuitry exists in the lumbar enlargement that makes it possible to stand and create synergistic, rhythmic stepping activity in the lower limbs. In the past 20 years, clinicians have tried to reengage such these circuits for standing and walking in the lower spinal cord of paralyzed humans through novel paradigms of physical therapy, pharmacological stimulation of the spinal cord, or recently - epidural stimulation of the spinal cord. Although standing and stepping with these maneuvers are rudimentary at best, these human studies offer promise to restore controlled, lower extremity movement to the spinal cord injured (SCI) individual. Evidence from animal data suggests that more focal activation of intraspinal circuitry (IntraSpinal Micro-Stimulation - ISMS) would produce more fatigue resistant, natural standing and stepping activity in humans. To date, there has been no direct confirmation of such circuitry in the spinal cord of bipedal humans who have been paralyzed. Furthermore, mapping of such circuitry would provide the basis of a novel intraspinal neuroprosthetic that should be able to restore control of standing or walking in a manner that is much more physiologically normal and tolerable than by stimulating each individual muscle group. Proof of the existence of these spinal circuits in man, and the ability to activate and control these circuits by first mapping the spinal cord is the basis of this proposal.","The comparator interventions mentioned in the provided text are:

Many factors including genetics, diet, diseases, drugs, socioeconomic factors and environmental variables were considered to be related to the development of presbyacusis. Evidences have shown that genetic factors play an important role on presbyacusis. However, which genes or their genotypes are associated with presbycusis remain unknown.

The aim of this project was to evaluate the association between the genotype of candidate genes and presbyacusis by cross-section and case-control study. In the first stage, the investigators plan to select 700 healthy subjects older than 50 with symmetric, sensorineural hearing loss. The subjects will receive basic otologic examination, pure tone audiometry, questionnaire, and genotype analysis. Because gender and age would affect hearing loss significantly, The investigators will convert the hearing level of all subjects into a gender and age independent Z-score according to ISO 7029 standard. And, The investigators define subjects within higher 30 % of Z-score as the presbyacusis group, and subjects within lower 30% of Z-score as the control group. Finally, The investigators perform Chi square analysis to test the association between genotype of candidate genes or their combinations in both groups, and calculate the odds ratio for presbyacusis between different genotype of candidate genes. Further more, we will evaluate the effect of genotype of candidate genes, environment factors, and gene-environmental interaction on the severity of presbyacusis by multivariate logistic regression.

In the second stage, The investigators wish to know the pattern of genotype and hearing level in the high risk families, according to results from the first stage, by description and case-control study. The investigators will perform t-test to evaluate the difference of Z-score in both groups. Besides, The investigators try to evaluate the effects of genotypes, environment factors, and gene-environmental interaction on hearing level in high risk families by multivariate logistic regression.","The comparator interventions in the provided clinical trial text are not clearly defined.

Repair-HD is an EU FP7 consortium that aims to establish all the preclinical requirements for transplantation of stem cell-derived neurons in HD in order to replace those lost to the disease process. These requirements include the generation of new clinical assessments for detailed monitoring of patients with HD who have undergone cell replacement therapy.

This protocol describes the beta testing of a new clinical assessment battery: Core Assessment Protocol for Intrastriatal Transplantation in HD version 2 (CAPIT-HD beta / CAPIT-HD2). CAPIT-HD beta represents a substantial revision of a previous CAPIT-HD battery published over 20 years ago, which is in need of updating in order to accommodate knowledge from clinical transplant studies over this time and to take advantage of technological advances in patient assessment.

HD is a complex disorder in which there is relentless deterioration of motor, cognitive and behavioural functions, usually from mid-life onwards. The original CAPIT battery aimed to capture elements of change in all three domains, but was based predominantly on subjective semi-quantitative assessment tools that have poor inter-rater reliability. Moreover, a number of deficits, such as impairments in social cognition, were not recognised when the original CAPIT-HD battery was constructed, so we have developed novel assessments of these deficits, some of which are included in CAPIT-HD beta. The beta testing will take place in established HD clinical centres in Cardiff, Manchester, Paris, and Munster by teams of researchers who are experienced in leading clinic research in HD. Patients with early to moderate HD will be assessed at baseline, and at one and twelve months later, to assess the reliability and sensitivity of the CAPIT-HD beta battery. Arrangements for data storage and analysis are in place.","The comparator interventions in the provided text are not explicitly mentioned. Therefore, the list of comparator interventions is none."
55,NCT02571335,"Intensity-dependent Impacts of Training on Growth Factors BDNF and Cognitive Functions in Persons With Multiple Sclerosis - a Single-center Randomized Controlled Trial | Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic immune-mediated disease of the central nervous system, accompanied by varying inflammatory manifestations, demyelinization and axonal loss. With chronic progressive or relapsing-remitting disease onsets persons with MS (pwMS) progressively develop impaired functional capacity and show reduced physical activity and cognitive decline compared to healthy controls. The primary aims of rehabilitation in pwMS are therefore to increase levels of activity and participation leading to increase independence of the participants. In general exercise ranges from passive physiotherapy-based interventions to submaximal endurance training sessions. Current recommendations advise pwMS that exercise should be matched with the individual performance capacities. Exercise training in pwMS then has the potential to target and improve many components outlined in the ICF-model.

Cytokines and neurotrophic factors have received increased attention in MS research and addressed the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) as an important mediator of neuronal regeneration linking the effects of exercise with MS pathogenesis. Data show positive connections between elevated neurotrophin concentrations, induction of neuroplasticity, recovery of the motor and cognitive functions and the applied training intensities. Similarly, intensive and progressive exercise bouts seem to have greater benefits on cardiorespiratory fitness and maximum voluntary strength in elderly and seniors with dementia. Therefore, specific exercise prescriptions may be necessary for targeting the specific impairments also in pwMS.

This study aims to evaluate two different training modalities (intensive versus normal) in pwMS. It is expected that both modalities will improve cardiorespiratory fitness and cognitive functions in pwMS. Based on the findings that higher training intensities facilitate greater benefits, it is expected that pwMS will tolerate the intensive training intensities and show positive connections to elevated neurotrophin concentrations.

The results will to help to clearer understand the benefits of each type of exercise conveyed for pwMS and will assist in the development of patient-specific exercise prescriptions.","The comparator interventions extracted from the clinical trial are: intensive training and normal training.

One of the complications with the greatest impact in people with SCI is Neuropathic Pain (NP). Pain, mainly chronic pain, has an effect on emotional states, cognition regarding pain and anticipation which leads to the catastrophization of the pain. This form of pain is related to chronic diseases that develop with pain of poor prognosis and are detrimental to quality of life therefore having enormous impacts on health systems. The physiological mechanisms of Hydrotherapy on pain are clear and there is evidence of its use in the management of painful syndromes of difficult treatments such as that for fibromyalgia and chronic lumbar pain, as well as its positive effect on pain perception. However, the effects of hydrotherapy on the NP of patients with SCI are unknown.

Randomized, controlled clinical trial of parallel groups. A randomized sequence will be carried out in balanced blocks to assign the intervention (Hydrotherapy) or the control (Standard Physical Therapy), to a sample of 28 participants, 14 for each group. Each of the interventions (hydrotherapy and physical therapy) will last 9 weeks, for a total of 18 sessions (2 weekly sessions). Two measurements will be made, baseline (pre-intervention) and a second time one month after the end of the intervention. The validated Spanish scales will be used: NP-4 (NP Screening), Numerical Pain Scale (END), PCS (Pain Catastrophization), SF-36 (Health-related quality of life) and WHODAS 2.0 (Disability). The primary outcome is the level of NP and its catastrophization, and the secondary outcomes are level of disability and quality of life. With 28 participants fully measured, it is possible to have 80% power to find differences between the groups with respect to the primary outcomes. All information will be analyzed using average comparisons with 95% confidence. The analysis will be carried out by Intention to Treat (ITT) taking all the randomized participants. Missing data will be processed through multiple imputation chains. Generalized mixed linear models will be used comparing the standardized baseline and post-intervention averages of each group and between each group, obtaining 95% confidence intervals and p-values. Subgroup analysis will be performed adjusting confounders and interactions. A significant difference will be considered when the value of p is less than 0.05.

Children who have speech sound disorders as preschoolers are at risk for the later emergence of dyslexia, a risk that often reveals itself in the form of poor phonological awareness skills during the preschool period. Traditional speech therapy methods focus on articulation accuracy and do not focus on the child's more abstract knowledge of the sound system of the language. The ultimate objective of this research program is to prevent reading disability in children who present with speech sounds disorders.

It is expected that a combination of treatment approaches that focus on speech perception skills and vocabulary knowledge will have a superior impact on phonological awareness in comparison with a treatment approach that focuses solely on articulation accuracy.","The comparator interventions in the clinical trial are:

1. Treatment approaches that focus on speech perception skills and vocabulary knowledge
2. Treatment approach that focuses solely on articulation accuracy"

77,NCT03893214,"Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy for Acrophobia in a Single Session Design and the Role of Respiration for Fear Extinction | In recent years, in the treatment of phobias, exposure therapy in virtual reality is becoming more and more popular as an alternative for in-vivo exposure. Effectiveness of virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) is comparable to in-vivo exposure therapy, though several characteristics of the VRET have an impact on the outcome of the therapy (e.g., immersion into the virtual environment (VE), familiarity with the VE). Additionally, the use of VRET varies from multiple exposure sessions to single-session VRET. Single-session therapy has an economic advantage and in in-vivo, post therapy outcomes show good results. In virtual reality, the assessment of outcome post therapy and in follow-up of single-session therapies is still needed for an evaluation of this approach. As an outcome measure, behavioral assessments are especially relevant for effectiveness studies as in fear of heights it is closer to the individual's life to know how high they voluntarily go up a building than to have hypothetical self-report questionnaire results.

Much research has been conducted on physiological correlates of the subjective experience of fear in exposure therapy as they are assumed to be a prerequisite for effective exposure treatment. Skin conductance level (SCL) and heart rate can be used for objective manipulation checks of exposure therapy. SCL is found to increase during fearful situations independent of setting while heart rate only increases during in-vivo exposure. Contrary to heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV) is not thoroughly studied in VRET yet. HRV is associated with the adaptability of an organism to new environments and cognitive functioning. High Frequency HRV is found to be reduced in individuals with mental disorders, and positive and negative mood inductions lead to differential HRV responses overall.

Respiration is a well-studied correlate of emotional experience and especially of the experience of fear and anxiety. In a series of experiments, it was found that sighing is tightly associated with relief in or after fearful or stressful situations and might become maladaptive when used disproportionally often. This study shows that respiration parameters have an impact on the handling of fearful situations in a reciprocal way. On the one hand, fear leads to an increased respiration rate and sigh rate while on the other hand, an altered sigh rate or respiration rate might have an impact on the experience of fear and be used as a defensive reaction to a fearful situation. As such, specific respiration patterns might act as emotion-driven behaviors (EDB). EDBs are responses to emotions that result in a short-term reduction of a negative state while in long-term support the maintenance of the phobia.

The aim of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a single-session VRET for acrophobia with a multimethod outcome design. Familiarity of the setting will be high with the use of a well-known tower in this area. Immersion into the VE will be assessed with a presence questionnaire. For a manipulation check, physiological data will be assessed, i.e., SCL, heart rate and HRV. Primary outcome measure will be a behavioral approach test (BAT) as behavioral assessment. Additionally, after four weeks, a follow-up assessment will investigate the stability of the effectiveness of the VRET in comparison to a waitlist control group. A second aim of this study is to investigate the impact of respiration as an EDB on the effectiveness of an exposure therapy. Therefore, the association between respiration and outcome of the VRET will be analyzed.

Hypothesis 1: Participants in the VRET condition show less height avoidance in the BAT after the intervention than participants in the control condition.

Hypothesis 2: Participants in the VRET condition show less height avoidance in the BAT in a four-week follow-up assessment than participants in the control condition.

Hypothesis 3: Participants in the VRET condition score significantly lower on the Acrophobia Questionnaire at follow-up than participants in the control condition.

Hypothesis 4: During the VRET, breath holding is used as EDB. Participants that hold their breath, profit less from the VRET than participants that do not hold their breath.

Hypothesis 5: During the VRET, sighing is used as EDB. Participants that sigh, profit less from the VRET than participants that do not sigh.","The comparator interventions in the provided clinical trial are the VRET condition and the control condition.

80,NCT00909012,"Quantitative Requirements of Docosahexaenoic Acid for Neural Function in Children With Phenylketonuria | Patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) have an inborn error in the metabolism of the amino acid phenylalanine (Phe) and thus must follow a strictly controlled protein-restricted diet from early infancy. This protein-restricted diet is devoid of natural dietary sources of n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA), such as eggs, meat, milk or fish. Therefore, blood concentrations of n-3 LC-PUFA, especially of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are reduced in PKU children compared to healthy controls. DHA availability is considered important for optimal neurological function. Previous studies have shown that neural function of PKU children is improved by high dose supplementation of fish oil providing DHA, as shown by significant improvements of both visual evoked potential latencies and of fine motor skills and coordination, but no dose response relationship has been established so far.

This multicentric double-blind randomized trial aims at determining quantitative DHA requirements for optimal neural function in PKU children. Patients with classical PKU from several major treatment centers in Europe will be randomized to receive between 0 and 8 mg of DHA per kg body weight daily for a duration of 6 months. Biochemical (fatty acid composition of plasma phospholipids, lipoprotein metabolism and metabolic profiles), and functional testing (visual evoked potentials, fine motor skills, cognitive function and markers of immune function) will be performed at baseline and after 6 months. Intake per kg body weight will be related to outcome parameters and thus a possible dose response relationship will be defined. The results from this study are expected to contribute to the improvement of the diet of PKU patients, but they also have the potential to help defining quantitative DHA needs of healthy children.

The primary hypothesis is that supplementation with DHA improves visual function in children with PKU.","The comparator interventions in the clinical trial are as follows:

- Patients with classical PKU will be randomized to receive between 0 and 8 mg of DHA per kg body weight daily for a duration of 6 months.

89,NCT03540602,"Polyphenol Rich Supplementation on Markers of Recovery From Intense Resistance Exercise | Strength training is commonly used as an intervention to increase muscle mass, thus improving a person's ability to undertake activities of daily living, or enhance athletic performance. The strength training regimen itself, while ultimately having beneficial effects, causes muscle fibers to be damaged, which the body has to recover from. As the body recovers, it rebuilds the muscle tissue and after multiple consecutive bouts of strength training, the muscle eventually becomes larger and stronger. Thus, it is the recovery from strength training exercise that ultimately determines how well the body adapts. Where inadequate recovery could eventually lead to overtraining and/or injury, optimizing the recovery process from strength training could maximize strength training adaptations. This concept of optimizing recovery has led to development of many supplements, including antioxidants, which may reduce the damage associated with strength training activities and therefore enhance positive adaptations. The purpose of this study is to assess the ability of a polyphenol rich supplementation to aid the recovery process from a demanding bout of resistance exercise",The comparator interventions in the clinical trial are: none
